>   >   > - (D) If any Receiving Party delivers a timely Exception Objection Notice, then during the continuous 30-day period beginning on the date such Exception Notice is delivered to the other Parties (the “Negotiation Period”), the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith to agree upon the existence or non-existence of a Material Adverse Exception Event and the Exception Handling Addendum to be approved in response to such Material Adverse Exception Event.
>   >   > - (E) If the Parties fail to reach an agreement resulting in an Exception Handling Addendum during the Negotiation Period (or a determination that no Material Adverse Exception Event has occurred), then any Party may initiate an arbitration action to resolve the issues in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 14.7; provided the decision of the arbitrators shall include, among any other determinations, a determination of the treatment of any Distributed Subject Property and whether to extend, modify or terminate the covenants applying to the Distributed Subject Property during the Standstill Period.

**II.13 Establishment of Series.**

The Members, acting by a Majority in Interest, shall have full power and authority to approve the establishment of one or more Series (as defined below), and upon such approval, the Administrative Member shall establish such Series pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.3 through the adoption of a Series Addendum (as defined below) and, if such Series shall be a “registered series” (within the meaning of the Act), the execution and filing of a Certificate of Registered Series with the Office of the Secretary of State of Delaware in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C hereto, whereupon such Series shall be established. The Interests in each Series are and shall be separate and distinct from the Interests in any other Series. In connection with the establishment of a Series hereunder, the Administrative Member may, in its sole discretion and without obtaining the consent, vote or other approval of the other Members:

- (i) issue Interests without limitation as to number to such persons or entities and for such amount and type of consideration, including cash or securities, at such time or times and on such terms as the Administrative Member may deem appropriate and in connection therewith to admit such persons or entities as Members associated with such Series,
- (ii) establish, designate and fix such preferences, voting powers, rights, duties and privileges and business purpose of each Series as the Administrative Member may from time to time determine, which preferences, voting powers, rights, duties and privileges may be senior or subordinate to (or in the case of business purpose, different from) any existing Series and may be limited to specified property or obligations of the Company or profits and losses associated with specified property or obligations of the Company,
- (iii) divide or combine the Interests of any Series into a greater or lesser number without thereby materially changing the proportionate beneficial interest of the Interests of such Series in the assets held with respect to that Series and
- (iv) combine the assets and liabilities belonging to any two or more Series into assets and liabilities belonging to a single Series. The relative preferences, voting powers, rights, duties and privileges and business purpose of any Series established by the Administrative Member will be as set forth in an addendum to this Agreement that covers the terms specific to a particular Series, each of which shall be a part of this Agreement (each, a “Series Addendum”) and, to the extent of any inconsistency between the provisions set forth herein and in the Series Addendum, the terms of the Series Addendum shall control. A form of Series Addendum is attached as Exhibit B hereto. [Without limiting the authority of the Members to establish Series in the future as set forth above, the Parties hereby establish [insert name of Series] as a Series, and the Series Addendum for [name of Series] is annexed hereto and, if such Series is intended to be a “registered series” (within the meaning of the Act), the Administrative Member shall file a Certificate of Registered Series for such Series, whereupon such Series shall be formed] . Subject to variation by any Series Addendum, Interests of any Series that may from time to time be established by the Administrative Member shall (unless the Administrative Member otherwise determines at the time of establishing the same) have the following relative rights and preferences:

> - (a) Assets Belonging to Series. All consideration received by the Company for the issue or sale of Interests of a particular Series, together with all assets in which such consideration is invested or reinvested, all income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, including any proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds in whatever form the same may be, shall be held for the benefit of the Members who have Interests in that Series and shall irrevocably belong to that Series for all purposes, subject only to the rights of creditors of such Series and shall be so recorded upon the books of account of the Company. Such consideration, assets, income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, including any proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds, in whatever form the same may be, are herein referred to as “assets belonging to” or “assets of” that Series. In the event that there are any assets, income, earnings, profits and proceeds thereof, funds or payments that are not readily identifiable as assets of any particular Series (collectively “General Assets”), the Administrative Member shall allocate such General Assets to, between or among any one or more of the Series in such manner and on such basis as the Administrative Member, in its sole discretion, deems fair and equitable, and any General Assets so allocated to a particular Series shall be assets belonging to that Series. Each such allocation by the Administrative Member shall be conclusive and binding upon the Members associated with all Series for all purposes. Pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Act, the records maintained for each Series shall account for the assets of Series separately from the assets of all other Series and the General Assets of the Company not allocated to such Series. No Series shall have any right to or interest in the assets belonging to any other Series, and no Member shall have any right or interest with respect to the assets belonging to any Series in which it does not have an Interest. The Administrative Member shall operate the business and manage the assets belonging to each Series in the manner described in this Agreement (including the Series Addendum relating to such Series).
> - (b) Liabilities Belonging to Series. The assets belonging to each particular Series shall be charged with the liabilities of that Series and all expenses, costs, charges and reserves attributable to that Series. The debts, liabilities, obligations, expenses, costs, charges and reserves so charged to a Series are herein referred to as “liabilities belonging to” or “liabilities of” that Series. The Administrative Member shall allocate general debts, liabilities, obligations, expenses, costs or charges of the Company that are not readily identifiable with respect to any particular Series (“General Liabilities”) among the Series in such manner as may be determined by the Administrative Member, in its sole discretion, to be fair and reasonable.
> - (c) Liabilities of Series. In accordance with the applicable provisions of the Act, without limitation of the provisions of paragraph (ii) hereof relating to the allocation of General Liabilities, the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular Series shall be enforceable against the assets of such Series only, and not against the assets of the Company generally or against any other Series thereof, and, except to the extent provided in paragraph (ii) hereof relating to the allocation of the General Liabilities, none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the Company generally or any other Series shall be enforceable against the assets of such Series. Notice of the foregoing limitation on liabilities of a Series shall be set forth in the Certificate of Formation.
> - (d) Voting. On each matter submitted to a vote or permitted or required to be taken by the Members:
>   > - (1) with respect to any vote, matter or action affecting a Series, each Member who holds an Interest in such Series shall be entitled to a vote proportionate to its Interest in such Series as recorded on the books of the Company with respect to such Series, all Members who hold an Interest in such Series shall vote as a separate class, and the vote or action of a Majority in Interest of the Members associated with such Series shall control; and
>   > - (2) notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a vote, matter or action affecting the Company as a whole (regardless of whether such vote, matter of action also affects one or more Series), each Member shall be entitled to a vote proportionate to the proportion that its Capital Contributions to all Series and the Company bears to the Capital Contributions of all Members to all Series and the Company, all Members shall vote together as a single class, and the vote or action of Members holding a majority of all Capital Contributions to all Series and the Company shall control.
> - For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 2.3(d) shall apply solely to the extent that one or more Series has been established.
> - (e) Application of this Agreement with respect to Series. References to the Company in this Agreement shall be deemed to include references to each Series, as applicable, as determined by the Administrative Member in its sole discretion. This Agreement and all provisions herein will be interpreted in a manner to give full effect to the separateness of each Series. The Administrative Member shall take reasonable steps as are necessary to implement the provisions of this Section.

**II.14 Specific Disclaimer.** The Members agree to the disclaimers set forth here:

The use of an LLC with protected or registered Series is a relatively recent legal advent and is subject to various legal uncertainties regarding its validity and use cases, including, without limitation, uncertainties relating to:

- the non-recognition of such type of legal entity and structure by other U.S. States, such as California, New York and Massachusetts;

- the novelty and lack of established precedent regarding LLCs with Series and any liability “spill-over” risks between the Series and the Company;

- the lack of regulatory clarity regarding the taxation of Series of an LLC and an LLC with Series; and

- the lack of legal and regulatory clarity regarding the treatment of Series of an LLC and an LLC with Series in bankruptcy proceedings under federal law;

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, the Members shall be entitled to dissolve or terminate, as applicable, the Company or any Series at any time, in the event where there is any risk or threatened risk of liability with respect to the existence of Series or the Company in relation to the Company’s or any Series’ affairs.

## ARTICLE III

In determining Fair Market Value of an asset, the provisions of Section 1.704-1 of the Treasury Regulations shall be applied.
> - (c) If any Interest is Transferred pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the transferee will succeed to the Capital Account and the respective Interest of the transferor to the extent the Capital Account and Interest is attributable to the Interests so Transferred.

**III.5 Interest on Capital.** No Member will be entitled to receive any interest on its Capital Contributions or Capital Account.

**III.6 Return of Capital Contributions.** Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Member has any right to withdraw or reduce its Capital Contribution or Commitment.

## ARTICLE IV

### MEMBERS

**IV.1 Admission of Members.**

> - (a) Except in connection with a Transfer permitted pursuant to Article VIII, only individuals will be admitted to the Company as Members. The individuals who, as of the Initial Closing Date, have supplied the Company with a signed, fully completed Subscription Agreement, which has been accepted by the Administrative Member, together with an executed signature page to this Agreement and any other information that may be required pursuant to Section 12.3 (as determined in good faith by the Administrative Member) shall be admitted as Members effective as of the Initial Closing Date. [With the consent of a Majority in Interest or in the case of a Transfer permitted by Article VIII, with the consent of the Administrative Member pursuant to Section 8.3] additional Members may be admitted to the Company and existing Members may increase their Commitments from time to time on such date and upon such terms and conditions, including Closing Conditions, as determined by the Administrative Member; provided no Person shall be admitted as a Member unless and until such Person has supplied the Company with a signed, fully completed Subscription Agreement, which has been accepted by the Administrative Member, together with an executed signature page to this Agreement and any other information that may be required pursuant to Section 12.3 (as determined in good faith by the Administrative Member).
> - (b) Notwithstanding Section 4.1(a), the Company will be deemed “closed”, such that no additional Members may be admitted except in connection with a Transfer permitted by Article VIII, or increased Commitments are no longer accepted following the earliest of (i) the date the Administrative Member closes the Company, (ii) the maximum number of Members is reached (as specified by the Administrative Member), and (iii) the set maximum amount of Capital Contributions to the Company is reached (as specified by the Administrative Member ). This can be seen when the closedSyndicate event is emitted for a given Syndicate address within the Syndicate smart contract.

**IV.2 Nature of Ownership.** Interests held by Members constitute personal property.

**IV.3 Dealing with Third Parties.** Unless admitted as a Member as provided in this Agreement, no Person will be considered a Member. The Company and the Administrative Member need deal only with Persons admitted as Members. The Company, the Series, and the Administrative Member will not be required to deal with any other Person (other than with respect to Distributions to assignees pursuant to assignments in compliance with Article VIII) merely because of an assignment or transfer of any Interest to that Person whether by reason of the Disability of a Member or otherwise; provided, however, that any Distribution by the Company or the applicable Series to the Person shown on the Interest Register as a Member or to its legal representatives, or to the assignee of the right to receive such Member’s Distributions as provided in this Agreement, will relieve the Company or the applicable Series and the Administrative Member of all liability to any other Person who may be interested in that Distribution by reason of any other assignment by the Member or by reason of its Disability, or for any other reason.

**IV.4 Members are not Agents.** Pursuant to Article V of this Agreement, the management of the Company and each Series is vested in the Members as a group. No Member acting alone has any right to direct the management of the Company or any Series except as expressly authorized by the Act or this Agreement. Except as expressly authorized in this Agreement or in writing by a Majority in Interest, no Member, acting solely in the capacity of a Member, is an agent of the Company or any Series, nor does any Member, have any power or authority to bind or act on behalf of the Company or any Series in any way, to pledge its credit, to execute any instrument on its behalf or to render it liable for any purpose.

**IV.5 Expenses.**

> - (a) The Company or the applicable Series shall maintain reserves from the assets of the Company or the applicable Series (including Capital Contributions made by the Members) for the payment of the expenses, liabilities and obligations of the Company or the applicable Series, including for taxes, contingent liabilities or probable losses or foreseeable expenses, in such accounts and in such amounts that the Administrative Member deems necessary or appropriate, subject to increase or reduction at the Administrative Member’s sole discretion. All organizational and operating costs and expenses of the Company or the applicable Series will be paid by the Company or the applicable Series (excluding any regulatory expenses, or other costs incurred by the Administrative Member in connection with its daily operations, including but not limited to salary and other payments to employees of the Administrative Member).
> - (b) The Administrative Member will, to the extent of available funds of the Company or the applicable Series, pay or cause to be paid, all Company operating costs and expenses incurred by the Company or the applicable Series or on its behalf, including (i) out-of-pocket expenses that are associated with disposing of Investments, including transactions not completed; (ii) extraordinary expenses, if any (such as certain valuation expenses, litigation and indemnification payments); (iii) interest on borrowed money, investment banking, financing and brokerage fees and expenses, if any; (iv) expenses associated with the Company or the applicable Series’ tax compliance costs, tax returns and Schedules K-1, custodial, legal and insurance expenses, any taxes, fees or other governmental charges levied against the Company or the applicable Series; (v) attorneys’ and accountants’ fees and disbursements on behalf of the Company or the applicable Series; (vi) insurance, regulatory or litigation expenses (and damages); (vii) expenses incurred in connection with the winding up or liquidation of the Company or the applicable Series; (viii) expenses incurred in connection with any amendments to the constituent documents of the Company or the applicable Series, and related entities; (ix) except as set forth in Section 4.5(a), all out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Member in connection with its services as such to the Company or the applicable Series; and (x) expenses incurred in connection with the distributions to the Members and in connection with any meetings of the Members called by the Administrative Member.
> - (c) If the Administrative Member determines at any time, or from time to time, that the available funds of the Company or the applicable Series (after the drawdown of any then unfunded Commitments) are not sufficient to pay the Company’s or the applicable Series’ operating costs and expenses, then the Administrative Member may, but is not required to, loan its own funds to the Company or the applicable Series for the payment of such costs and expenses (an “Advance”). The Company or the applicable Series shall reimburse the Administrative Member for any such Advance together with interest on such Advance from the date of such Advance at an annual rate of [10%]. Any such Advance, together with the interest thereon, shall be an expense of the Company or the applicable Series and shall be paid by the Company or the applicable Series prior to making any further Distributions. Payments by the Company or the applicable Series shall be applied first to accrued interest on and then to the principal of such Advance. The determination to apply funds of the Company or the applicable Series to the payment of such Advance shall be at the Administrative Member’s discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, an Advance by the Administrative Member will not constitute a Capital Contribution by the Administrative Member.
> - (d) If the Administrative Member does not make an Advance, then the Administrative Member shall notify the Members and describe in reasonable detail the operating costs and expenses requiring additional Company funds. Such notification shall also state the aggregate amount of additional Capital Contributions (“Additional Capital Contributions”) being requested from the Members and each Member’s pro rata share of such amount. (such a request, a “Capital Call”) Within 15 days following the date of such Capital Call (the “Deadline”), each Member may, but is not obligated to, make an Additional Capital Contribution in an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on its Interest) of the aggregate amount of the Additional Capital Contributions requested by the Administrative Member. An Additional Capital Contribution made by a Member shall be treated as having been received on the later of the Deadline with respect to the applicable Capital Call or the date on which such Additional Capital Contribution is actually made.
> - (e) If any Member (the “Non-Contributing Member”) fails to make any Additional Capital Contribution (or any portion thereof) requested by a Capital Call (a “Shortfall Amount”) by the Deadline, the Administrative Member shall notify each Member that is not a Non-Contributing Member in respect of such Capital Call (a “Contributing Member”) of the aggregate Shortfall Amount in writing, and each Contributing Member may elect to make a further Additional Capital Contribution in the amount of such Shortfall Amount (or a portion thereof). If more than one Contributing Member elects to make a further Additional Contribution, the Shortfall Amount shall be allocated to such Contributing Members pro rata based on their Interests, but not in excess of the actual Additional Capital Contribution such Contributing Member has elected to contribute. Such further Additional Capital Contributions shall be made within 15 days after the Deadline.
> - (f) If the Company or the applicable Series has insufficient funds to pay its operating costs and expenses after a Capital Call and any Advances, the Administrative Member, in its discretion, may sell assets of the Company or the applicable Series without any Consent of the Members in order to pay the Company’s or the applicable Series’ operating costs and expenses.

**IV.6 Nature of Obligations between Members.** Except as otherwise required by applicable law, nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to constitute any Member, in that Member’s capacity as a Member, an agent or legal representative of any other Member or to create any fiduciary relationship between Members for any purpose whatsoever. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, a Member has no authority to act for, or to assume any obligation or responsibility on behalf of, any other Member or the Company or any Series.

**IV.7 Status Under the Uniform Commercial Code.** All Interests will be securities governed by Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect from time to time in the State of Delaware. The Interests are not evidenced by certificates and will remain not evidenced by certificates. Neither the Company nor any Series is authorized to issue certificated Interests. The Company will record all Transfers of Members’ Interests made in accordance with Article VIII of this Agreement in the Interest Register.

## ARTICLE V

### MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF THE COMPANY

**V.1 Management.**

> - (a) Management of the Company and each Series is vested in the Members. Except for those matters delegated to the Administrative Member pursuant to this Agreement, the Members, acting by Majority in Interest (or such greater percentage specified in this Agreement with respect to a specified matter), have the exclusive management and control of the Company and its business and affairs, including all decisions related to the acquisition and disposition of Investments or otherwise required to be made by the Company as the holder of an Investment. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to the provisions of the Act, the Administrative Member has all power and authority to take all actions necessary to execute the decisions made by a Majority in Interest or otherwise delegated to it under this Agreement.
> - (b) A [Majority in Interest ] of the Members may at any time remove the Person then serving as the Administrative Member. The Administrative Member may also at any time, upon not less than 30 days prior notice, resign as the Administrative Member. The Members, by Majority in Interest, may also appoint an alternate Administrative Member to act on behalf of the Company or the applicable Series and the Members if the Administrative Member is temporarily unable to serve or is unwilling to serve in any particular circumstance. When so acting, the alternative Administrative Member shall have all the powers and authority delegated to the Administrative Member. Any vacancy in the position of the Administrative Member (whether from the removal, resignation or death of such Administrative Member or otherwise) shall be automatically filled by the then appointed alternate Administrative Member, or if none, by the Members acting by a Majority in Interest.
> - (c) The Members may agree to (i) delegate any matters or actions authorized to be taken by the Members under this Agreement to the Administrative Member, specified Member(s) or third Persons and (ii) appoint any Persons, with titles as the Members may select, to act on behalf of the Company or the applicable Series, with power and authority as the Members may delegate from time to time. Any delegation by the Members may be rescinded at any time by a Majority in Interest. If a Person is appointed as an officer of the Company, then, unless otherwise specified in such appointment, such Person shall have the authority and duties customarily held by an officer of a Delaware corporation with such title.
> - (d) Third parties dealing with the Company or the applicable Series or its assets shall not be required to investigate the authority of the Administrative Member or whether any approval of the Members is required or has been obtained with respect to any matter and may rely conclusively upon any certificate of the Administrative Member to the effect that it is authorized to and is acting on behalf of the Company or the applicable Series as to any matter relating to the Company or its assets and Members. The Administrative Member shall have the authority to execute any agreements, instruments, documents and certificates on behalf of the Company or the applicable Series as its authorized signatory and the signature of the Administrative Member , when acting pursuant to this Article V, will be sufficient to bind the Company or the applicable Series.

**V.2 Duties and Obligations of the Administrative Member.**

In addition to the duties and services of the Administrative Member elsewhere in this Agreement,

> - (a) The Administrative Member shall take all action that may be necessary or appropriate for the continuation of the Company’s valid existence and authority to do business as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware and of each other jurisdiction in which authority to do business is, in the judgment of the Administrative Member, necessary or advisable.
> - (b) The Administrative Member shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall file on or before the due date (or any extension) any federal, state or local tax returns required to be prepared or filed by the Company and each Series.
> - (c) To the extent of available funds of the Company and each Series, the Administrative Member shall cause the Company and each Series to pay any taxes or other governmental charges levied against or payable by the Company or such Series; provided, however, that the Administrative Member will not be required to cause the Company or any series to pay any tax so long as the Administrative Member or the Company (or any series) is in good faith and by appropriate legal proceedings contesting the validity, applicability or amount the tax and the contest does not materially endanger any right or interest of the Company or the applicable Series.
> - (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise applicable provision of law or equity, whenever in this Agreement, the Administrative Member is permitted or required to make a decision (i) in its “sole discretion” or “discretion” or under a grant of similar authority or latitude, the Administrative Member will be entitled to consider only those interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests, and will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the Company or the Members, or (ii) in its “good faith” or under another expressed standard, the Administrative Member shall act under that express standard and will not be subject to any other or different standards. Unless otherwise expressly stated, for purposes of this Section 5.2(d), the Administrative Member will be deemed to be permitted or required to make all decisions hereunder in its sole discretion.

**V.3 No Fiduciary Duty.** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no Member, including the Administrative Member when acting as such, owes any fiduciary duties of any kind whatsoever to the Company or any Series, or to any of the Members, including, but not limited to, the duties of due care and loyalty, whether those duties were established as of the date of this Agreement or any time hereafter, and whether established under common law, at equity or legislatively defined. It is the intention of the Members and the Company that those fiduciary duties be affirmatively eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, including the Act, and the Members hereby waive any rights with respect to those fiduciary duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Members have the duties, liabilities and obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement.

**V.4 The Members May Engage in Other Activities.** Subject to the terms of any other agreement between a Member and the Company or any Series, no Member (including the Administrative Member) is obligated to devote all of its time or business efforts to the affairs of the Company or any Series, provided that the Administrative Member shall devote the time, effort and skill as it determines in its sole discretion may be necessary or appropriate for the responsibilities delegated to it under this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, any Member may have other business interests and may engage in other activities in addition to those related to the Company and the Series. The Members and their respective Affiliates may acquire or possess interests in a Portfolio Company and the interests may be of a different class or type, with different rights and preferences, than those held by the Company or the applicable Series. Likewise, the Members and their respective Affiliates may acquire or possess interests in other companies or business ventures that are competitive with a Portfolio Company or the Company or any Series. Neither the Company or the Series nor any Member will have the right, by virtue of this Agreement, to share or participate in other investments or activities of any other Member or to the income derived therefrom.

## ARTICLE VI

### ALLOCATIONS OF NET INCOME AND NET LOSS

**VI.1 Allocation of Net Income and Net Loss.** Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Net Income and Net Loss (including individual items of profit, income, gain, loss, credit, deduction and expense) of the Company or the applicable Series will be allocated among the Members in a manner such that the Capital Account balance of each Member, immediately after making that allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal (proportionately) to the Distributions that would be made to that Member pursuant to Section 10.4 if the Company or the applicable Series were dissolved or terminated, its affairs wound up and its assets sold for cash equal to their Fair Market Value, all Company liabilities were satisfied (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the Fair Market Value of the assets securing that liability), and the net assets of the Company or the applicable Series were distributed in accordance with Section 10.4 to the Members immediately after making that allocation, adjusted for applicable special allocations, computed immediately prior to the hypothetical sale of assets.

**VI.2 Allocation Rules.** In the event that Members are issued Interests on different dates, the Net Income or Net Loss allocated to the Members for each Fiscal Year during which Members receive Interests will be allocated among the Members in accordance with Section 706 of the Code, using any convention permitted by law and selected by the Administrative Member. For purposes of determining the Net Income, Net Loss and individual items of income, gain, loss credit, deduction and expense allocable to any period, Net Income, Net Loss and any other items will be determined on a daily, monthly or other basis, as determined by the Administrative Member using any method that is permissible under Section 706 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all individual items of Company or Series income, gain, loss and deduction will be divided among the Members in the same proportions as they share Net Income and Net Loss for the Fiscal Year or other period in question.

**VI.3 Limitation on Allocation of Net Losses.** There will be no allocation of Net Losses to any Member to the extent that the allocation would create a negative balance in the Capital Account of that Member (or increase the amount by which that Member’s Capital Account balance is negative).

**VI.4 General Tax Allocations.** Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.4, the taxable income or loss of the Company or the applicable Series will be allocated pro rata among the Members associated therewith in the same manner as the corresponding items of Net Income, Net Loss and separate items of income, gain, loss, credit, deduction and expense (excluding items for which there are no related tax items) are allocated among the Member for Capital Account purposes; provided, that in the event there is a difference between the “tax book” value of a Company or Series asset and the asset’s adjusted tax basis at the time of the asset’s contribution or revaluation pursuant to this Agreement, all items of tax depreciation, cost recovery, amortization, and gain or loss with respect to such asset shall be allocated among the Members to take into account the disparities between the “tax book” values and the adjusted tax basis with respect to such properties in accordance with any method selected by the Administrative Member that is permitted by the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Sections 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code.

**VI.5 Special Tax Allocations.**

> - (a) Minimum Gain Chargeback. In the event there is a net decrease in the Company Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year, the minimum gain chargeback provisions described in Sections 1.704-2(f) and (g) of the Treasury Regulations will apply.
> - (b) Member Minimum Gain Chargeback. In the event there is a net decrease in Member Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year, the partner minimum gain chargeback provisions described in Section 1.704-2(i) of the Treasury Regulations will apply.
> - (c) Qualified Income Offset. In the event a Member unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation or Distribution described in of Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) of the Treasury Regulations, which adjustment, allocation or Distribution creates or increases a deficit balance in that Member’s Capital Account, the “qualified income offset” provisions described in Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Treasury Regulations will apply.
> - (d) Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions will be allocated in accordance with and as required in the Treasury Regulations.
> - (e) Member Nonrecourse Deductions. Member Nonrecourse Deductions will be allocated to the Members as required in Section 1.704-2(i)(1) of the Treasury Regulations.
> - (f) Intention. The special allocations in this Section 6.5 are intended to comply with certain requirements of the Treasury Regulations and will be interpreted consistently. It is the intent of the Members that any special allocation pursuant to this Section 6.5 will be offset with other special allocations pursuant to this Section 6.5. Accordingly, special allocations of Company or Series income, gain, loss or deduction will be made in such manner so that, in the reasonable determination of the Administrative Member, taking into account likely future allocations under this Section 6.5, after those allocations are made, each Member’s Capital Account is, to the extent possible, equal to the Capital Account it would have been were this Section 6.5 not part of this Agreement.
> - (g) Recapture Items. In the event that the Company or the applicable Series has taxable income in any Fiscal Year that is characterized as ordinary income under the recapture provisions of the Code, each Member’s distributive share of taxable gain or loss from the sale of Company or Series assets (to the extent possible) will include a proportionate share of this recapture income equal to that Member’s share of prior cumulative depreciation deductions with respect to the assets which gave rise to the recapture income.
> - (h) Tax Credits and Similar Items. Allocations of tax credits, tax credit recapture, and any items related thereto will be allocated in those items as determined by the Administrative Member considering the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii).
> - (i) Consistent Treatment. All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Company or the applicable Series will be allocated among the Members for federal income tax purposes in a manner consistent with the allocation under this Article VI. Each Member is aware of the income tax consequences of the allocations made by this Article VI and hereby agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Article VI in reporting its share of Company or Series income and loss for income tax purposes. No Member will report on its tax return any transaction by the Company or the applicable Series, any amount allocated or distributed from the Company or the applicable Series or contributed to the Company or the applicable Series inconsistently with the treatment reported (or to be reported) by the Company or the applicable Series on its tax return nor take a position for tax purposes that is inconsistent with the position taken by the Company or the applicable Series.
> - (j) Modifications to Preserve Underlying Economic Objectives. If, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, there is a change in the Federal income tax law (including the Code as well as the Treasury Regulations, rulings, and administrative practices thereunder) which makes modifying the allocation provisions of this Article VI it necessary or prudent to preserve the underlying economic objectives of the Members as reflected in this Agreement, the Administrative Member will make the minimum modification necessary to achieve that purpose.

**VI.6 Allocation of Excess Nonrecourse Liabilities.** “Excess nonrecourse liabilities” of the Company or the applicable Series as used in Section 1.752-3(a)(3) of the Treasury Regulations will first be allocated among the Member pursuant to the “additional method” described in that section and then in accordance with the manner in which the Administrative Member expects the nonrecourse deductions allocable to those liabilities will be allocated.

**VI.7 Allocations in Respect of a Transferred Interest.** Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, amounts of Net Income, Net Loss and special allocations allocated to the Members will be allocated among the appropriate Members in proportion to their respective Interests. If there is a change in any Member’s Interest for any reason during any Fiscal Year, each item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Company or the applicable Series for that Fiscal Year will be assigned pro rata to each day in that Fiscal Year in the case of items allocated based on Interests, and the amount of that item so assigned to that day will be allocated to the Member based upon that Member’s Interest at the close of that day. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the net amount of gain or loss realized by the Company or the applicable Series in connection with a sale or other disposition of property by the Company or the applicable Series will be allocated solely to the Members having Interests on the date of that sale or other disposition.

**VI.8 Allocations in Year of Liquidation Event.** Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties intend for the allocation provisions of this Article VI to produce final Capital Account balances of the Members that will permit liquidating Distributions to be made pursuant to the order set forth in Section 10.4. To the extent that the allocation provisions of this Article VI would fail to produce the final Capital Account balances, the Administrative Member may elect, in its sole discretion, to (a) amend those provisions if and to the extent necessary to produce that result and (b) reallocate income and loss of the Company or the applicable Series for prior open years (including items of gross income and deduction of the Company or the applicable Series for those years) among the Members to the extent it is not possible to achieve that result with allocations of items of income (including gross income) and deduction for the current year and future years, as approved by the Administrative Member. This Section 6.8 will control notwithstanding any reallocation or adjustment of taxable income, taxable loss, or related items by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrative Member will have the power to amend this Agreement without the Consent of the other Members, as it reasonably considers advisable, to make the allocations and adjustments described in this Section 6.8. To the extent that the allocations and adjustments described in this Section 6.8 result in a reduction in the Distributions that any Member will receive under this Agreement compared to the amount of the Distributions that Member would receive if all those Distributions were made pursuant to the order set forth in Section 10.4, the Company or the applicable Series may make a guaranteed payment (within the meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code) to that Member (to be made at the time that Member would otherwise receive the Distributions that have been reduced) to the extent that payment does not violate the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code or may take other action as reasonably determined by the Administrative Member to offset that reduction.

## ARTICLE VII

### DISTRIBUTIONS

**VII.1 Generally.**

> - (a) The Company or the applicable Series will first use available assets to pay or set aside reserves for the payment of the costs, expenses, debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company or the applicable Series as set forth in Section 4.5.
> - (b) Subject to Sections 7.4 and 7.5, the Company or the applicable Series will make Distributions, at such times, in such amounts and of such types (i.e. in cash or in kind) as determined by a Majority in Interest. Distributions shall be made to the Members associated therewith pro rata in accordance with their respective Interests.
> - (c) For the avoidance of doubt, prior to the dissolution of the Company or the applicable Series pursuant to Section 10.1, the Company or the applicable Series will not make Distributions in kind except to the extent of Liquidity Event Proceeds without the consent of the Administrative Member. Any expenses relating to brokerage commissions, escrow fees, clearing and settlement charges, custodial fees, and any other costs relating to the event giving rise to such Liquidity Event Proceeds and the receipt and Distribution of Liquidity Event Proceeds by the Company or the applicable Series (“Distribution Expenses”) will be paid by the Company or the applicable Series prior to any Distributions. The amount of Liquidity Event Proceeds distributable to the Members will be net of any Distribution Expenses.

**VII.2 Non-Cash Distributions.** Whenever a Distribution provided for in this Section 7.2 is payable in property other than cash, the value of the Distribution will be deemed to be its Net Fair Market Value as of the date of Distribution. The Capital Accounts of the Members will be adjusted accordingly as the result of any Distribution in kind.

**VII.3 Return of Distributions.** Any Member receiving a Distribution in violation of the terms of this Agreement shall return that Distribution (or cash equal to the Net Fair Market Value of any property so distributed, determined as of the date of Distribution) promptly following the Member’s receipt of a request to return the Distribution from the Administrative Member. No third party will be entitled to rely on or enforce the obligations to return Distributions set forth in this Agreement or to demand that the Company, any Series, or any Member make any request for any such return.

**VII.4 Form of Distribution.** Distributions pursuant to this Article VII will be comprised of (a) assets and securities constituting Liquidity Event Proceeds, and/or (b) Distributable Cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Distribution of securities will be made to any Member to the extent that Member would be prohibited by applicable law from holding those securities. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Member, Distributions will be made to its respective brokerage account; provided that any Distribution of Distributable Cash may, in the sole discretion of the Administrative Member, be made, in whole or in part, to the account from which such Member’s Capital Contributions were paid.

**VII.5 Amounts Withheld.** Any amounts withheld with respect to a Member pursuant to any federal, state, local or foreign tax law from a Distribution by the Company or the applicable Series to the Member will be treated as paid or distributed, as the case may be, to the Member for all purposes of this Agreement. In addition, the Company or the applicable Series may withhold from Distributions amounts deemed necessary, in the sole discretion of the Administrative Member, to be held in reserve for payment of accrued or foreseeable permitted expenses of the Company or the applicable Series. Each Member hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the applicable Series from and against any liability with respect to income attributable to or Distributions or other payments to that Member (including, without limitation, any “imputed underpayment” within the meaning of Section 6225 of the Code attributable to such Member, as determined by the Administrative Member). Any other amount that the Administrative Member determines is required to be paid by the Company or the applicable Series to a taxing authority with respect to a Member pursuant to any federal, state, local or foreign tax law in connection with any payment to or tax liability (estimated or otherwise) of the Member shall be treated as a loan from the Company or the applicable Series to that Member. If that loan is not repaid within 30 days from the date the Administrative Member notifies that Member of that withholding, the loan will bear interest from the date of the applicable notice to the date of repayment at a rate at the lesser of (a) [10]% or (b) the maximum legal interest rate under applicable law, compounded annually. In addition to all other remedies the Company or the applicable Series may have, the Company or the applicable Series may withhold Distributions that would otherwise be payable to that Member and apply that amount toward repayment of the loan and interest. Any payment made by a Member to the Company or the applicable Series pursuant to this Section 7.5 will not constitute a Capital Contribution. The obligations of a Member pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall survive the termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the Company or applicable Series and the withdrawal of such Member from the Company or applicable Series or transfer of its interest in the Company or applicable Series.

**VII.6 Member Giveback.** Except as required by applicable law, Section 7.3 or Section 7.5, no Member will be required to repay to the Company or the applicable Series, any other Member, or any creditor of the Company or the applicable Series, all or any part of the Distributions made to that Member.

**VII.7 No Creditor Status.** A Member will not have the status of, and is not entitled to the remedies available to, a creditor of the Company or the applicable Series with regard to Distributions that the Member becomes entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement and the Act.

**VII.8 Limitations on Distributions.** Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Distribution shall be made to any Member on account of its Interest if the Distribution would violate the Act or other applicable law.

**VIII.4 Additional Restrictions.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Transfer of an Interest (including any Transfer of an interest in Company profits, losses or distributions) shall be permitted unless the Administrative Member otherwise consents, in its sole discretion, if such Transfer would cause the Company or the applicable Series (a) to have more than 100 partners, as determined for purposes Section 7704 of the Code; (b) to be treated as a publicly traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code; (c) to be required to be registered as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “40 Act”); (d) to hold any “plan assets” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), or (e) in the Administrative Member’s sole determination, to be subject to any burdensome regulatory or reporting requirements, any adverse tax or fiscal consequences or otherwise in breach of any applicable law or agreement to which the Company or the applicable Series is a party.

**VIII.8 Death or Disability of a Member.** Upon the Disability or death of a Member, the provisions of Section 18-705 of the Act shall apply.

**VIII.9 Compulsory Redemption.** A Majority in Interest may, by notice to any Member, force the sale of all or a portion of that Member’s Interest on terms as the Administrative Member determines to be fair and reasonable, or take other action as it determines to be fair and reasonable in the event that the Administrative Member determines or has reason to believe that: (a) that Member has attempted to effect a Transfer of, or a Transfer has occurred with respect to, any portion of that Member’s Interest in violation of this Agreement; (b) continued ownership of that Interest by that Member is reasonably likely to cause any of the events set forth in Section 8.4; (c) continued ownership of that Interest by that Member may be harmful to the business or reputation of the Company or the applicable Series or the Administrative Member; (d) any of the representations or warranties made by that Member under this Agreement or its Subscription Agreement was not true when made or has ceased to be true; (e) any portion of that Member’s Interest has vested in any other Person by reason of the bankruptcy, dissolution, incompetency or death of that Member; (f) such Member has failed to fund any Additional Capital Contribution; or (g) it would not be in the best interests of the Company or the applicable Series, as determined by the Administrative Member in its sole discretion, for that Member to continue ownership of its Interest.

>   > - (3) the entry of a judicial decree of dissolution of the Company pursuant to the Act.

- At any time that (i) there are no Interests outstanding of any particular Series previously established or (ii) a particular Series never acquired any Portfolio Company or any other assets, has no liabilities, and did not receive any Capital Contributions, the Administrative Member may terminate that Series, cancel any Interests therein for no consideration and rescind the establishment thereof.

**X.2 Date of Dissolution.** Dissolution of the Company or the applicable Series will be effective on the day on which the event occurs giving rise to the dissolution, but the Company or the applicable Series will not terminate or cease to exist until the assets of the Company or the applicable Series have been liquidated and distributed as provided in this Agreement and a Certificate of Cancellation for the Company or the applicable Series has been filed in accordance with Section 10.8. Notwithstanding the dissolution of the Company or the applicable Series, prior to the termination of the Company or the applicable Series, the business of the Company or the applicable Series and the rights and obligations of the Members will continue to be governed by this Agreement.

**X.3 Winding Up.** Upon the occurrence of any event specified in Section 10.1, the Company or the applicable Series will continue solely for the purpose of winding up its affairs in an orderly manner, liquidating its assets, satisfying the claims of its creditors, and distributing any remaining assets in cash or in kind, to the Members in accordance with this Agreement. The Liquidating Trustee will be responsible for overseeing the winding up and liquidation of the Company or the applicable Series and will cause the Company or the applicable Series to sell or otherwise liquidate all of the Company’s or the applicable Series’ assets except to the extent the Liquidating Trustee determines to distribute any assets to the Members in kind, discharge or make provision for all liabilities of the Company or the applicable Series and all costs relating to the dissolution, winding up, and liquidation and distribution of assets, establish reserves as may be necessary to provide for contingent liabilities of the Company or the applicable Series (for purposes of determining the Capital Accounts of the Members, the amounts of those reserves will be deemed to be an expense of the Company or the applicable Series and will be deemed income to the extent it ceases to be reserved), and distribute the remaining assets to the Members, in the manner specified in Section 10.4. The Liquidating Trustee will be allowed a reasonable time for the orderly liquidation of the Company or the applicable Series’ assets and discharge of its liabilities, so as to preserve and upon disposition maximize, to the extent possible, the value of the Company’s or the applicable Series’ assets.

**X.4 Liquidation.** The Company’s or the applicable Series’ assets, or the proceeds from the liquidation of the Company’s or the applicable Series’ assets, will be paid or distributed in the following order:

> - (b) next, to the establishment of those reserves for contingent liabilities of the Company or the applicable Series as are deemed necessary by the Liquidating Trustee (other than liabilities for which reasonable provision for payment has been made and liabilities, if any, for Distribution to Members and former Members under the Act);
> - (c) next, to Members and former Members in satisfaction of any liabilities for Distributions under the Act, if any;
> - (d) next, to the Members, on a pro rata in accordance with their Interests.

**X.5 Distributions in Kind.** Any non-cash asset distributed to one or more Members will first be valued by the Administrative Member at its Fair Market Value to determine the Net Income, Loss and special allocations that would have resulted if that asset had been sold for that value, which amounts will be allocated pursuant to Article VI, and the Members’ Capital Accounts will be adjusted to reflect those allocations. The amount distributed and charged to the Capital Account of each Member receiving an interest in the distributed asset will be the Net Fair Market Value of that interest.

**X.6 No Liability.** Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon a liquidation within the meaning of Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) of the Treasury Regulations, if any Member has a negative Capital Account balance (after giving effect to all contributions, Distributions, allocations and other Capital Account adjustments for all Fiscal Years, including the Year in which that liquidation occurs), neither that Member nor the Liquidating Trustee will have any obligation to make any contribution to the capital of the Company or the applicable Series, and the negative balance of that Member’s Capital Account will not be considered a debt owed by that Member or any Liquidating Trustee to the Company or the applicable Series or to any other Person for any purpose; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 10.6 will relieve any Member from any liability under any promissory note or other affirmative commitment that Member has made to contribute capital to the Company or the applicable Series.

**X.7 Limitations on Payments Made in Dissolution.** Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, each Member will be entitled to look only to the assets of the Company or the applicable Series for Distributions (including Distributions in liquidation) and the Parties will have no personal liability for any Distributions.

**X.8 Certificate of Cancellation.** Upon completion of the winding up of the Company’s affairs, the Liquidating Trustee will cause to be filed a Certificate of Cancellation, in accordance with the Act, of the Certificate of Formation.

**X.9 Conversion to a Trust.** If, on the Outside Date, a Liquidity Event has not occurred, the Administrative Member may appoint a third-party liquidator or custodian at the expense of the Company or the applicable Series or distribute the assets of the Company or the applicable Series to a liquidating trust or Entity for the benefit of the Members (a “Liquidating Vehicle”). Interests in any Liquidating Vehicle will generally be subject to terms comparable to Interests (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Distribution Expenses); provided that, in addition to other expenses contemplated in this Agreement, interests in a Liquidating Vehicle may be subject to actual expenses incurred in connection with the ongoing operations of the liquidating vehicle. The Administrative Member or the liquidating trustee, in its sole discretion, may establish reserves for contingencies under this Section 10.9, including with respect to interests in any liquidating vehicle.

## ARTICLE XI

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; STANDARD OF CARE; INDEMNIFICATION

**XI.1 Limitation of Liability.** Unless explicitly agreed upon, the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company and each Series, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, will be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company or such Series, and will not be those of the Members, or the Covered Persons.

**XI.2 Standard of Care; Liability.** Neither the Members nor the Covered Persons will have any personal liability whatsoever to the Company, any Series, any Member, or their Affiliates on account of that Person’s role within the Company or any Series or by reason of that Person’s acts or omissions in connection with the conduct of the business of the Company or any Series so long as that Person acts in good faith for a purpose which the Person reasonably believes to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company or such Series. Notwithstanding the preceding, nothing contained in this Agreement will protect that Person against any liability to which that Person would otherwise be subject by reason of (a) any act or omission of that Person that involves gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith, fraud, or willful and material breach of a material provision of this Agreement or any Subscription Agreement or any management agreement or other agreement with or for the benefit of the Company; (b) any transaction from which that Person or its Affiliate derives any improper personal benefit; or (c) a breach of any representation or warranty by such Member made in this Agreement or its Subscription Agreement.

**XI.3 Indemnification.** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Members and the Covered Persons will be entitled, out of the Company or Series assets, to be indemnified against and held harmless from any and all liabilities, judgments, obligations, losses, damages, claims, actions, suits or other proceedings (whether civil or criminal, pending or threatened, before any court or administrative or legislative body, and as the same are accrued, in which a Member or Covered Person may be or may have been involved as a party or otherwise or with which he, she or it may be or may have been threatened (a “Proceeding”)) and reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements (including legal and accounting fees and expenses) of any kind and nature whatsoever (collectively, “Covered Losses”) that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted at any time against a Member or Covered Person (whether or not indemnified against by other parties) in any way related to or arising out of this Agreement, the administration of the Company or any Series, or the action or inaction of a Member or Covered Person (including actions or inactions pursuant to Article X on the Company’s or Series’ dissolution or termination) or under contracts with the Company or any Series, except that the Members and Covered Persons will not be entitled to indemnity for Covered Losses with respect to any matter as to which such Member or Covered Person has been finally adjudicated in any action, suit, or other proceeding, or otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction, to have committed an act or omission involving his, her or its own gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith, fraud, willful and material breach of a material provision of this Agreement or any Subscription Agreement or any management agreement or other agreement with or for the benefit of the Company or any Series, or from which such Person derived an improper personal benefit. The indemnities contained in this Article XI will survive the termination of this Agreement.

**XI.4 Contract Right; Expenses.** The right to indemnification conferred in this Article XI will be a contract right. A Member’s or a Covered Person’s right to indemnification under this Agreement includes the right to require the Company or the applicable Series to advance the expenses incurred by that Member or Covered Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition subject to an obligation to return the amount so advanced if it is ultimately determined that the Member or Covered Person has not met the standard of conduct required for indemnification.

**XI.5 Nonexclusive Right.** The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article XI will not be exclusive of any other right which any Person may have or later acquire under any statute or agreement, or under any insurance policy obtained for the benefit of any Administrative Member, Partnership Representative or officer of the Company or the applicable Series (it being understood that if any such insurance policy is obtained, it shall be at the expense of the Company or the applicable Series).

**XI.6 Severability.** If any provision of this Article XI is determined to be unenforceable in whole or in part, that provision will nonetheless be enforced to the fullest extent permissible, it being the intent of this Article XI to provide indemnification to all Persons eligible under this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

**XI.7 Insurance.** The Administrative Member may cause the Company or the applicable Series to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any Covered Person who is or was an agent of the Company or the applicable Series against any liability asserted against that Covered Person capacity as an agent.
