(Rolling Simple Agreement for Future Equity)

THIS INSTRUMENT (the “Rolling SAFE”) CERTIFIES THAT in exchange for the payment by the person listed on the signature page attached hereto (the “Investor”, and together with all other Rolling SAFE holders, “Rolling SAFE Investors”) of the aggregate purchase amount indicated on the signature page that will be generated on the Site (as defined below) and attached hereto (the “Purchase Amount”) on or about the date indicated on the signature page that will be generated on the Site (as defined below) and attached hereto, [company-name], a [Delaware corporation] (the “Company”), issues to the Investor the right to certain equity interests and/or shares of the Company’s Capital Stock, subject to the terms and conditions described below. This instrument also constitutes a binding, enforceable agreement being entered into among the Investor, the other Rolling SAFE Investors and the Company. See Section 2 for certain defined terms.

### 1 Events

> - **1.a** Purchase of Tokens.  
> > - **a.i** As consideration for the Investor paying the Purchase Amount and executing this Rolling SAFE on the Site, the Company shall issue to Investor a number of Rolling SAFE Tokens equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Effective Purchase Price. The Company shall similarly issue to the other Rolling SAFE Investors who tender a purchase price in subsequent transactions a number of Rolling SAFE Tokens determined by dividing the purchase amounts under their respective Rolling SAFEs by the Effective Purchase Price reflected on such Rolling SAFE Investor’s Dashboard at the time of their purchase, as set forth herein. Rolling SAFE Tokens shall have no rights other than the rights provided in this Rolling SAFE and any subsequently executed transaction agreements between the Investor and the Company.
> > - **a.ii** All payments due under this Rolling SAFE may be made in the forms and using the methods indicated on the Site which shall include but is not limited to, (A) payment by virtual currency from Investor’s digital wallet, and (B) by bank wire, ACH or SEPA transfers in immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the Company (together, (A) and (B) the “Token Payment”). All payments hereunder shall be denominated in U.S. dollars.
> > > - **ii.A** Investor hereby acknowledges and agrees that this Rolling SAFE will not be deemed complete and executed until the Company has confirmed receipt of the Token Payment in the account previously provided by the Company to Investor. Accordingly, the purchase price indicated to Investor on the Site at the date and time the Investor executes this Rolling SAFE (such price, the “Original Effective Purchase Price”) may materially differ from the Effective Purchase Price (which is determined as of the date and time the Company confirms receipt of the Token Payment, such date and time the, “Token Payment Confirmation Date”). Investor hereby acknowledges this risk and consents to the Company automatically processing Investor’s purchase of the Rolling SAFE Tokens at the Effective Purchase Price in effect as of the Token Payment Confirmation Date so long as the Effective Purchase Price in effect as of such Token Payment Confirmation Date is within 5% of the Original Effective Purchase Price.
> > > - **ii.B** If the difference between the Effective Purchase Price in effect as of the Token Payment Confirmation Date and the Original Effective Purchase Price exceeds 5%, the Company shall contact Investor pursuant to the notice provisions provided herein (or at the most recent contact information Investor has provided on the Site) and request that Investor reaffirm their interest in purchasing the Rolling SAFE Tokens at the Effective Purchase Price in effect as of the Token Payment Confirmation Date pursuant to a method of confirmation determined by the Company in its sole discretion. In the event that the Investor confirms their intent to proceed with the purchase of Rolling SAFE Tokens at such new Effective Purchase Price, the Company shall process the Investor’s payment and Investor shall receive Rolling SAFE Tokens equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Effective Purchase Price in effect as of the Token Payment Confirmation Date. If the Investor indicates that they do not wish to purchase the Rolling SAFE Tokens at the Effective Purchase Price in effect as of the Token Payment Confirmation Date, the Investor shall be eligible to withdraw their funds in accordance with the Company’s instructions provided to Investor, less applicable fees incurred by the Company in processing Investor’s Token Payment. To the extent that an Investor does not respond to the Company in connection with a notice provided under this Section 1(a)(ii)(B).
> > > - **ii.C** In connection with any Token Payment, the Company shall be allotted up to six (6) business days to confirm receipt of the Investor’s Token Payment and process such payment, provided that if the Effective Purchase Price as of the date of the Token Payment Confirmation Date is within 5% of the Original Effective Purchase Price, the Company shall be permitted to process such payment in accordance with Section 1(a)(ii)(B) above, regardless of how many business days have elapsed since Investor has initiated the Token Payment. If the difference between the Effective Purchase Price in effect as of the Token Payment Confirmation Date and the Original Effective Purchase Price exceeds 5%, the Company will follow the notice provisions set forth in Section 1(a)(ii)(B) above, and Investor shall be entitled to withdraw their funds from the Site and cancel this Rolling SAFE. If, as of the Token Payment Confirmation Date, the Effective Purchase Price is within 5% of the Original Effective Purchase Price and the Company chooses to process such payment, the Company shall issue to Investor a Confirmation Notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A setting out the total Purchase Amount, Original Effective Purchase Price per Token, and number of Rolling SAFE Tokens issuable under this Agreement.
> > - **a.iii** The Company may also issue Rolling SAFE Tokens to certain other existing holders of other convertible equity instruments (the “Prior Convertibles”), in such amounts as mutually agreed by and between the Company and such investors, subject to required adjustments to the Rolling SAFE Equity Percentage per Section 1(e) of this Agreement.  
> > - **a.iv** In addition, to the extent that the Company has allocated Rolling SAFE Tokens for distribution to service providers as indicated on the Site, the Company may issue or have previously issued Rolling SAFE Tokens to such service providers.
> - **1.b** Liquidity Event.  
> > - **b.i** If there is a Liquidity Event before the termination of this Rolling SAFE, the Investor shall, at its option, be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to either (A) receive a portion of Proceeds (if any) that are due and payable to the Rolling SAFE Investors as the result of such Liquidity Event as set forth the following subsection (the “Cash Option”) or (B) receive from the Company the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Pro Rata Share of the product of multiplying (x) the Rolling SAFE Equity Percentage and (y) the Liquidity Capitalization (the “Equity Option”). If the Investor fails to select the Equity Option by written notice to the Company within thirty (30) days’ notice by the Company of any such Liquidity Event, the Investor shall be deemed to have chosen the Cash Option.
> > - **b.ii** In the event the Investor elects to take the Cash Option then, subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below, the amount payable in the event of a Liquidity Event shall be equal to the amount payable on the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Pro Rata Share of the product of multiplying (x) the Rolling SAFE Equity Percentage and (y) the Liquidity Capitalization (the “Conversion Amount”).
> > - **b.iii** In the event the Investor elects to take the Equity Option then, the number of shares of Common Stock the Investor shall be entitled to receive shall be equal Pro Rata Share of the product of multiplying (x) the Rolling SAFE Equity Percentage and (y) the Liquidity Capitalization; provided, however, the Equity Option may be conditioned by the Company (in its sole discretion) upon Investor (1) having agreed to enter into any lock-up agreement reasonably requested by an underwriter in connection with an Initial Public Offering and (2) satisfying any relevant investor requirements required by the Company.
> > - **b.iv** Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with a Change of Control intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, the Company may reduce the cash portion of Proceeds payable to the Investor by the amount determined by its board of directors in good faith for such Change of Control to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that such reduction (A) does not reduce the total Proceeds payable to such Investor and (B) is applied in the same manner and on a pro rata basis to all securityholders who have equal priority to the Investor under Section 1(d).
> - **1.c** Dissolution Event. If there is a Dissolution Event before the termination of this Rolling SAFE, the Investor will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds equal to the Conversion Amount, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to the consummation of the Dissolution Event.
> - **1.d** Liquidation Priority. In a Liquidity Event or Dissolution Event, this Rolling SAFE is intended to operate like standard non-participating, junior Preferred Stock. The Investor’s right to receive its Conversion Amount is:
> > - **d.i** Junior to payment of outstanding indebtedness and creditor claims, including contractual claims for payment and convertible promissory notes (to the extent such convertible promissory notes are not actually or notionally converted into Capital Stock);
> > - **d.ii** Junior to payment of any outstanding senior series of Preferred Stock of the Company or any Converting Securities with similar senior liquidation preferences;
> > - **d.iii** On par with payments for other SAFEs and/or Preferred Stock who are also receiving Conversion Amounts or Proceeds on a similar as-converted to Common Stock basis, and if the applicable Proceeds are insufficient to permit full payments to the Investor and such other SAFEs and/or Preferred Stock, the applicable Proceeds will be distributed pro rata to the Investor and such other SAFEs and/or Preferred Stock in proportion to the full payments that would otherwise be due; and
> > - **d.iv** Senior to payments for Common Stock.
> - **1.e** Rolling SAFE Equity Percentage Adjustment. In the event that the Company issues Rolling SAFE Tokens to one or more Rolling SAFE Investors in connection with the conversion of Prior Convertibles (such Rolling SAFE Tokens to be issued, the “Conversion Rolling SAFE Tokens”), the Rolling SAFE Equity Percentage shall be increased, concurrently with such issuance, to a new percentage (calculated to the nearest ten thousandth of a percent) in accordance with the following formula: CP2 = CP1 \* (A + B)/A.  For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:
> > - **e.i** “CP2” shall mean the Rolling SAFE Equity Percentage in effect immediately after such issuance or deemed issuance of Conversion Rolling SAFE Tokens;
> > - **e.ii** “CP1” shall mean the Rolling SAFE Equity Percentage in effect immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance of Conversion Rolling SAFE Tokens;
> > - **e.iii** “A” shall mean the number of Rolling SAFE Tokens outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance of Conversion Rolling SAFE Tokens (treating for this purpose as outstanding all Rolling SAFE Tokens reserved but unissued by the Company); and
> > - **e.iv** “B” shall mean the number of Conversion Rolling SAFE Tokens to be issued to a Rolling SAFE Investor in connection with the conversion of a Prior Convertible, including the Investor’s Prior Convertible (if any).
> - **1.f** Termination. This Rolling SAFE will automatically terminate (without relieving the Company of any obligations arising from a prior breach of or non-compliance with this Rolling SAFE) immediately following the earliest to occur of: (i) the issuance of Capital Stock to the Investor pursuant to the conversion of this Rolling SAFE under Section 1(b), or (ii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Investor pursuant to Section 1(b) or Section 1(c). In the event of a termination of this Rolling SAFE, all rights and obligations of this Rolling SAFE which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including such applicable rights and obligations of the parties under Sections 3-5 and the attached exhibits referenced therein. Notwithstanding termination of this Rolling SAFE, the parties shall remain liable to the other party for breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3 and 4 that arise prior to the termination of this Rolling SAFE.
