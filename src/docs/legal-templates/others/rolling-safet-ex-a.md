### RISK FACTORS

[company-specific-risk-factors]

Purchasing Rolling SAFE Tokens involves a number of potential risks and uncertainties, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risks and we encourage you to speak with your financial, legal and/or tax advisors as necessary before deciding whether to enter into the Rolling SAFE and purchase Rolling SAFE Tokens.

In addition, this Rolling SAFE and the documents included herewith include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements include all statements other than statements of historical facts and current status contained or incorporated by reference in this Rolling SAFE, including statements regarding our future financial position, our business strategy, and the plans and objectives of management for future operations. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions related to: significant regulatory uncertainty for digital assets; competition from other financial infrastructure software providers; expectations of our revenue growth rate to decline and anticipated downward pressure on our operating margin; fluctuations in our operating results; failure to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users; and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

We caution you not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this Rolling SAFE, which speak only as of the date hereof.

We also note that digital assets, including assets like the Rolling SAFE Tokens are highly speculative in nature, involve a high degree of risk and should be purchased only by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment. There can be no assurance that the Company’s investment objectives will be achieved or that a secondary market would ever develop for the Rolling SAFE Tokens, whether via the Company itself, via third party registered broker-dealers or otherwise. The risks described in this section should not be considered an exhaustive list of the risks that prospective investors should consider before investing in Rolling SAFE Tokens. Prospective investors should obtain their own legal and tax advice prior to making an investment in Rolling SAFE Tokens and should be aware that an investment in Rolling SAFE Tokens may be exposed to other risks of an exceptional nature from time to time. The following considerations are among those that should be carefully evaluated before making an investment in, and agreeing to enter into the Rolling SAFE and acquire Rolling SAFE Tokens.]

The Investor will not be afforded the full set of protections provided under the Exchange Act or comparable state law.

Further, a regulator could take action against the Company and Company Parties if it views the Rolling SAFE Tokens as a violation of existing law. Any of these outcomes would negatively affect the value of the Rolling SAFE Tokens and/or could cause the Company to cease operations.
> - **5.h** Virtual Currency Business Matters:
> > - h.i The Investor understands and agrees that the Company does not intend to operate in any state that requires the Company to obtain an applicable license to conduct a virtual currency business, and that if an Investor is a resident of a state that requires the Company to obtain an applicable license to conduct a virtual currency business, the Rolling SAFE Tokens are void and all rights and privileges of the Investor under the Rolling SAFE are canceled.

> - **5.j** The Investor further understands and agrees that it is anticipated that the Rolling SAFE Tokens will also be sold or resold outside the United States, which could subject the Company Parties or the Rolling SAFE Tokens to non-U.S. legal requirements, which could be significant. Non-U.S. regulation could lead to the same types of changes and outcomes described above with respect to U.S. regulation, and any of these outcomes would negatively affect the value of the Rolling SAFE Tokens and/or cause the Company Parties to cease operations.

### 6 Tax Requirements.

> - **6.a** The Investor certifies that the Investor has completed and submitted any required waiver of local privacy laws that could otherwise prevent disclosure of information to a Company Party, the IRS or any other governmental authority for purposes of complying with the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) (including without limitation in connection with FATCA, as defined below) or any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of the FATCA (an “IGA”), and any other documentation required to establish an exemption from, or reduction in, withholding tax or to permit the Company to comply with information reporting requirements pursuant to the Code (including, without limitation, in connection with FATCA or any IGA).

> - **6.e** By executing the Rolling SAFE, the Investor understands and acknowledges that (i) the Company (or any other Company Party) may be required to provide the identities of the Investor’s direct and indirect beneficial owners to a governmental entity, and (ii) the Investor hereby waives any provision of law and/or regulation of any jurisdiction that would, absent a waiver, prevent the Company from compliance with the foregoing and otherwise with applicable law as described in this Section 6.

### 8 Transfer and Storage of Personal Data.

**8.a** The Investor understands and agrees that in connection with the services provided by the Company, its personal data may be transferred and/or stored in various jurisdictions in which the Company Parties have a presence, including in or to jurisdictions that may not offer a level of personal data protection equivalent to the Investor’s country of residence.
**8.b** The Investor further understands and agrees that, although the Company Parties will use their reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the information provided in the Rolling SAFE, the Company Parties may disclose or transfer the Rolling SAFE Tokens, and disclose or transfer other data of Investor, as described in Section 3(a). Any disclosure, use, storage or transfer of information for these purposes shall not be treated as a breach of any restriction upon the disclosure, use, storage or transfer of information imposed on any person by law or otherwise.

> - **5.k** The Investor further understands and agrees that it is anticipated that the Rolling SAFE Tokens will also be sold or resold outside the United States, which could subject the Company Parties or the Rolling SAFE Tokens to non-U.S. legal requirements, which could be significant. Non-U.S. regulation could lead to the same types of changes and outcomes described above with respect to U.S. regulation, and any of these outcomes would negatively affect the value of the Rolling SAFE Tokens and/or cause the Company Parties to cease operations.
