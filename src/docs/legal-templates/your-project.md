## Introduction

This page recommends you prepare a worksheet about your project, to describe generally what you may need to evaluate how best to configure your treasury. Not only will this information help define how the project will operate, but may prove invaluable in navigating future decision trees.

A wide variety of Juicebox projects are created with even wider variety of ideas and preconceptions on its day to day operations. This is the beauty of Juicebox. Where ever you fall on this rainbow-color-spectrum, there are no wrong answers, however the degree of specificity will make navigating decisions easier. For the purposes of this section, the specificity of the information sought below is relevant to the degree you have any requirements to share with 3rd parties the purpose of your Juicebox project. While not knowing what the future will hold, a reasonable strategy is to try to make _some_ decision or reach a consensus with caveats that things change.

For the purposes of illustration, in an attempt to clearly define where you can `copy and paste` and `search and replace`, we will use **ExampleDAO**.

### **Basic project information.**

Hopefully the first thing you decided when creating a DAO was the name of your project and it purpose or description. The other resources in order of descending complexity website, Twitter, Discord, with the Logo being important for branding and other visual assets.

### **Publicly known individual.**

Juicebox is agnostic to whether individuals operating a project are anons or public figures seeking to collaborate. Whether a project member has an unimaginative user handle, or CryptoPunks-clad anon is not the primary not a concern, IRL reputations _do_ provide credibility to projects. Projects which were initialized with anonymous founders but after some critical threshold of members, contributions, expanded to include publicly known individuals are adapting to the level of trust the team needs to convey to a project.

### **Service provider.**

Additionally, projects may employ legal resources, termed a _Service provider_. For example, [OpenLaw](https://www.openlaw.io/) is both legal services company and technology for DAO tooling. [Flamingo](https://docs.flamingodao.xyz/FeesExpensesCarry.html#if-there-are-expenses-associated-with-operating-flamingo-who-is-responsible-for-them) is an example of a DAO which is wrapped, a Delaware corporation of the same name effectively is operated by the service provider. The Flamingo DAO is a LLC with a maximum of 99 members, statutory limit for investment clubs.[^4] Flamingo Dapp manages all aspects of on-chain assets, NFTs, ERC-20, and Cryptocurrency. Service providers usually cost at least 2% of all of the projects assets in addition to the billable hours, and may charge software development costs. Unfortunately, service providers are not common, nor affordable for most projects.

### **Entity purpose and scope.**

Your Juicebox project has a wide use of practical applications. If you have a formed idea of the project / entity you formed and its scope then authoring the following descriptions should be painless, alternatively, if you _do not_ have a clear idea of what your project, utility or service will be, then being specific enough so others may have some notion of what their contribution will enable.

> - One sentence description.
> - Paragraph description.
> - Full project description.
