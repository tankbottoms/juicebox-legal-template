None of the information, services, or materials offered on the Sites constitute, or are intended to constitute, legal, financial, tax, investment, or other advice, and you should not act or refrain from acting based on any information, services, or materials provided on the Sites. All content on the Sites is information of a general nature and does not address the unique circumstances of any particular user. You are strongly urged to consult with your own legal, financial, tax, investment, and other advisors as to all legal, financial, tax, and investment-related questions you have.

Please check with your legal and tax advisors to make the best decisions for your specific circumstances.

### 3. Risks Involved in the Use of the Smart Contracts.

The DAO protocol runs entirely on publicly accessible smart contracts explained in detail throughout the Juicebox DAO's online documents, currently available at [https://info.juicebox.money](https://info.juicebox.money). The Juicebox DAO's protocol is public infrastructure running well-known code. All consequences from interacting with networks running the protocol are borne by the entities who sign each transaction. The protocol works according to the specifications outlined in these docs to the extent the code is written and deployed correctly, which is a collective responsibility and is not guaranteed. There are major risks that the code is not written and deployed correctly. **Please do your own research.**

### 4. Source Code Repositories.

No Warranties. The DAO's source code Repository is only a presentation of information regarding certain view points and technologies. The statements contained in the Repository do not provide any advice, representation, warranty, certification, guarantee or promise relating to these technologies, any uses thereof or any of the other matters discussed in the Repository, nor does the Repository provide an offer or agreement to make such technologies available, maintain or update such technologies, or sell or buy any asset or enter into any transaction. You should not rely on the Repository as a basis for making any financial or other decision.

### 5. Intellectual Property.

The rights granted to you in the Agreement are subject to the following restrictions: (a) you shall not license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, reproduce, distribute, host or otherwise commercially exploit the DAO's Properties or any portion of the DAO's Properties, including the Site; (b) you shall not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other DAO Properties (including images, text, page layout or form) of the DAO; (c) you shall not use any metatags or other “hidden text” using the DAO’s name or trademarks; (d) you shall not modify, translate, adapt, merge, make derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of the DAO's Properties except to the extent the foregoing restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable law; (e) you shall not use any manual or automated software, devices or other processes (including but not limited to spiders, robots, scrapers, crawlers, avatars, data mining tools or the like) to “scrape” or download data from any web pages contained in the Site (except that we grant the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from the Site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (f) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the DAO's Properties may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means; and (h) you shall not remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained on or in the DAO's Properties. Any future release, update or other addition to the DAO's Properties shall be subject to the Agreement. The DAO, its suppliers and Service Providers reserve all rights not granted in the Agreement. Any unauthorized use of any the DAO's Property terminates the licenses granted by the DAO pursuant to the Agreement.

**1. The DAO Properties.** Except with respect to Your Content and User Content, you agree that the DAO and its suppliers own all rights, title and interest in the DAO Properties. You will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark, or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying any of the DAO Properties.

**2. Your Content.** The DAO does not claim ownership of Your Content. However, when you as a Registered User post or publish Your Content on or in the DAO Properties, you represent that you own and/or have a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive right (including any moral rights) and license to use, license, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, derive revenue or other remuneration from, and communicate to the public, perform and display Your Content (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known or later developed, for the full term of any worldwide intellectual property right that may exist in Your Content.

**3. License to Your Content.** Subject to any applicable account settings that you select, you grant the DAO a fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive and fully sublicensable right (including any moral rights) and license to use, license, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform, and publicly display Your Content (in whole or in part) for the purposes of operating and providing the DAO Properties to you and to our other Registered Users. Please remember that other Registered Users may search for, see, use, modify and reproduce any of Your Content that you submit to any “public” area of the DAO Properties. You warrant that the holder of any worldwide intellectual property right, including moral rights, in Your Content, has completely and effectively waived all such rights and validly and irrevocably granted to you the right to grant the license stated above. You agree that you, not the DAO, are responsible for all of Your Content that you Make Available on or in the DAO Properties. Any Content posted by you in your profile may not contain nudity, violence, sexually explicit, or offensive subject matter as determined by the DAO in its sole discretion. You may not post or submit for print services a photograph of another person without that person’s permission.

### 6. The Decentralized Application.

The DAO provides access to a DAPP, a decentralized finance application, (**“Application”**) on the Ethereum blockchain that allows individuals to contribute Ethereum assets including Ethereum, ERC-20, ERC-721, and other Ethereum-based assets (**“Cryptocurrency Assets”**) to the DAO Treasury as contributions. The Application may be configured as to emit project tokens (**"Project Tokens"**) which may or may not have utility. The Application spans a front-end application, middleware (including Interplanetary File System metadata, Graph indexers, Blocknative API functions, Infura services, Cloud Functions, etc.) and an array of Ethereum smart contracts - the user is required to authorize the execution of the Smart Contracts when interacting with their wallet at all times.

Using the DAO protocol may require that you pay a fee, such as gas fees on the Ethereum network, to perform a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that the DAO has no control over any transactions among Users over the DAO’s protocol, or the method of payment of any such transactions or any actual payments of such transactions. Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of the applicable cryptocurrency tokens stored at your DAO protocol-compatible wallet address (**“Cryptocurrency Wallet”**) to complete any such transaction on the DAO protocol or the Ethereum network before initiating such a transaction.

### 7. Access to the DAO Application.

If the DAO determines that the Site is being used by prohibited persons, it will take any and all actions to terminate that User’s access to the Site.**

### 10. Third Party Links.

The Site may contain hyperlinks or references to third party websites. Any such hyperlinks or references are provided for your information and convenience only. We have no control over third party websites and accept no legal responsibility for any content, material, or information contained in them. The display of any hyperlink and reference to any third-party website does not mean that we endorse that third party's website, products, or services. Your use of a third-party site may be governed by the terms and conditions of that third-party site.

### 11. Privacy Policy.

Certain areas of the Site or Application, including any and all interactions with the Ethereum blockchain, record your Cryptocurrency address and details of the transactions you authorize. You understand that transactions, including parties you transact with, specific Cryptocurrency Assets you hold, including unique ENS domain NFTs, third-party NFTs, the Cryptocurrency address, metadata associated with any Smart Contract such as the executing function, its arguments (or parameters) will contain in aggregate information which _may_ identify you personally.

The Ethereum blockchain transactions are not temporary or transient, but are permanently and permissionlessly accessible. The DAO, its contributors, and its affiliates are not engaged in profiling activities whatsoever; however, _any other_ third party, including government agencies and/or foreign adversaries, will have unfettered access to all of your transactions on the blockchain forever.

Your authorization of transactions with your Cryptocurrency address, using Cryptocurrency Tokens, will result in the indelible dissemination of information to the Ethereum blockchain. Notwithstanding, the Application, handles as little personal information as possible, only your Cryptographic address. With regards to transaction with the Application, including any payments or transfer of funds, any information you provide to the payment vendors we do not retain, have access to or control; your authorization of any payment or execution of transactions you provide to the site is voluntary, and final.

Additionally, the Sites may employ Fathom Analytics for website traffic analytics, which doesn't use cookies and complies with the GDPR, ePrivacy (including PECR), COPPA and CCPA. The decision to potentially use this privacy-friendly analytics software, was in large part to ensure your IP address is only briefly processed by this 3rd party, and the DAO and the Site have no way of identifying you (aside from the aforementioned indelible entire history of Cryptographic transactions). As per the CCPA, your personal information is de-identified.

The purpose of the DAO potentially using Fathom Analytics is to understand the Application website traffic in the most privacy-friendly way possible so that the DAO can continually improve the Application. The lawful basis as per the GDPR is "Article 6(1)(f); where our legitimate interests are to improve our website and business continually." Additionally, the DAO and its contributors have no interest in collecting this information.

### 12. Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability.

YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EXCEPT ONLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED UNDER THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO TERMS OF SERVICE WITH ANY LEGALLY REQUIRED WARRANTY PERIOD TO THE SHORTER OF THIRTY DAYS FROM FIRST USE OR THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED).

You should send your notice in an appropriate Discord channel via [https://discord.gg/movexyz](https://discord.gg/movexyz) or via a message on [https://chat.blockscan.com](https://chat.blockscan.com) addressed to the DAO Gnosis multi-signature address 0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6 (**"Notice Address"**). The DAO will send its notice to you by the Discord handle provided by you in connection with the aforementioned notice or to the Cryptographic address used in connection with the Application via the aforementioned https://chat.blockscan.com/.

**Binding Arbitration.** If you and the DAO are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or the DAO may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by confidential binding arbitration, and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. In such event, these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce; (i) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section; and (ii) this Section shall survive termination of these Terms.

Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other, and your grounds for appeal are limited. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitrator may award you the same damages and relief as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction could, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief. In addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, you will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted, at the option of the claimant, either in person or by video conference. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 30 days) if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and the DAO may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered and enforcement obtained thereon in any court having jurisdiction. All arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. Each party shall have the right to participate by video conference in order to minimize travel and expense burdens. Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, the arbitrator shall have authority to grant any form of appropriate relief, whether legal or equitable in nature, including specific performance.

**Restrictions/No Class Actions.** You and the DAO agree that any claim brought in connection with a Dispute, whether resolved through arbitration or not, will be brought between the DAO and you individually, and that you may not assert any such claim against the DAO as plaintiff or class Member in any purported class or representative proceeding. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) no Dispute between you and the DAO is to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or will utilize class action procedures; and (3) you may not bring any Dispute in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other Users of the Site or any other persons. If this specific provision is determined to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration section will be null and void.

**Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration.** You and the DAO agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration:

(1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or the DAO’s intellectual property rights; and (2) any claim for injunctive relief.

**Effect of Changes on Arbitration.** Notwithstanding the provisions of these Terms, if the DAO changes any of the terms of this Arbitration section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by electronic mail to the aforementioned Notice Address via https://chat.blockscan.com/) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of the DAO’s email to you notifying you of such change (whichever is earlier). By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and the DAO in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms.

**Small Claims Court.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.

**Release.** You hereby release the DAO, affiliates, Service Provider, and their successors from claims, demands, any and all losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, and property damage, that is either directly or indirectly related to or arises from your use of the DAO DAPP, including but not limited to, any use of any information, ratings, rankings, scores, tips, or advice Made Available via the DAO DAPP and any reliance thereon, of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of the Agreement or your use of the DAO DAPP. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.” The foregoing release does not apply to any claims, demands, or any losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, or property damage for any unconscionable commercial practice by a DAO Party or for such party’s fraud, deception, falsehood, promise, misrepresentation, or concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact in connection with the DAPP or the DAO Site or any Services provided hereunder.

### 15. Governing Law.

These Terms and all aspects of your use of the Site shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the _United States and the State of Delaware_ governing contracts entered into and to be fully performed in _Delaware_ (i.e., without regard to conflict of law’s provisions) regardless of your location except that the Arbitration section above shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. For the purpose of any judicial proceeding to enforce an arbitration award or incidental to such arbitration or to compel arbitration, or if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state and Federal courts sitting in _Georgetown, Delaware_, and agree that service of process in such arbitration or court proceedings shall be satisfactorily made upon a party if sent by certified, express or registered mail addressed to it at the address set forth in the books and records of the DAO, or if no such address has been provided, by email to the email address, or by notice via Discord, or by the aforementioned chat to the Notice Address provided by the relevant party to the DAO in connection with its use of the Site. With respect to any Disputes not subject to informal dispute resolution or arbitration (as set forth above), you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the state and Federal courts located in _Georgetown, Delaware_, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to, venue and jurisdiction in the state and Federal courts located in _Georgetown, Delaware_. To the extent non-U.S. laws mandate a different approach with respect to governing law, venue, statute of limitation, and dispute resolution method with respect to certain non-U.S. persons, each such required standard shall be applied, but all other provisions under this section shall remain in full force.

### 16. General.

If any clause or part of any clause of these Terms is found to be void, unenforceable or invalid, then it will be severed from these Terms, leaving the remainder in full force and effect, provided that the severance has not altered the basic nature of these Terms.

No single or partial exercise, or failure or delay in exercising any right, power or remedy by us shall constitute a waiver by us of, or impair or preclude any further exercise of, that or any right, power or remedy arising under these terms and conditions or otherwise.

If any of the provisions in these Terms are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder shall continue in full force and effect.

The DAO shall not be liable for any unforeseeable event beyond its reasonable control not caused by its fault or negligence (each, a “force majeure event”), which causes the DAO to be unable to perform its obligations under these Terms, and which it has been unable to overcome by the exercise of its due diligence, provided that the DAO shall use reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such causes of nonperformance, shall suspend performance only for such period of time as is necessary as a result of such force majeure event and shall resume performance as quickly as reasonably possible.

All disclaimers, indemnities and exclusions in these Terms shall survive termination of the Terms and shall continue to apply during any suspension or any period during which the Site is not available for you to use for any reason whatsoever.

These Terms and the documents referred to in them set out the entire agreement between you and us with respect to your use of the Site, the DAO and the services provided via the Site and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous representations, communications or agreements (written or oral) made between you or us.
