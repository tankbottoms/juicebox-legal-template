title: Trusts

A trust is a fiduciary relationship in which one party, known as the trustor, gives another party, the trustee, the right to hold title to property or assets for the benefit of a third party, the beneficiary. Other names for trustor are settler, or donor. A beneficiary is the person, people, or organization which is to receive the benefit, administered by the trustee. Trusts are established to provide legal protection for the trustor's assets, to make sure they are distributed according to the wishes of the trustors, to save time, reduce paperwork, avoid or reduce inheritance or estate taxes, shield assets from 3rd parties, etc.

Trusts are very versatile legal devices, in particular there are six broad categories living and testamentary, funded or unfunded, revocable or irrevocable.

Trusts are also opaque devices. That is to say, they are contracts between parties in which the terms of the contract are not usually accessible by other parties, therefore a Certificate of Trust or Declaration of Trust is an additional document which states the high-level terms of the agreement, i.e. what property the trustee has authority over, which is notarized and provided to 3rd parties who are required to validate ownership. The trustee may be required to provide the Certificate of Trust to a bank in order to open an account in which to deposit the property.

It is common to be required to have the Certificate of Trust signed by the trustee and notarized by an individual who has access or knowledge of the claims made in the declaration.

Kentucky, Louisiana, and Minnesota are the remaining barbaric states which do not have laws authorizing a creation of a Pet Trust.[^1] Seemingly progressive state of Florida has a specific pet trust statute codified Fla. Stat. §736.0408. By statute a trust may be established for the pet's lifetime or in the case of multiple pets, the trust may provide for the care, alternative caregivers, day-to-day requirements including emergency or extraordinary care for each, however the term of the extends through the lifetime of the last surviving pet.[^3] Leaving our furry friend's progeny at the mercy of the elements.

Many of these laws have been enacted in recent years. Mississippi is the latest state to adopt such a law in 2014, and is based on U.T.C. §408. Kentucky, Louisiana, and Minnesota are the only states that do not have laws authorizing pet trusts.).
