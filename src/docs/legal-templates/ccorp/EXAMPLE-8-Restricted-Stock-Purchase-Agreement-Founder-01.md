This Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement (the "***Agreement***") is made as of [date-of-adoption] by and between [company-name], a Delaware corporation (the "***Company***"), and [purchaser-name] (the "***Purchaser***").

In consideration of the mutual covenants and representations set forth below, the Company and the Purchaser agree as follows:

## 1. Purchase and Sale of the Shares.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company agrees to sell to the Purchaser and the Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Company on the Closing (as defined below) [shares-amount] shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value [par-value] per share (the "***Shares***"), at a price of [purchase-price] per share (the "***Purchase Price***"), for an aggregate purchase price of [aggregate-purchase-price]. 

As additional consideration for the Company's agreement to sell the Shares, the Purchaser hereby transfers and assigns to the Company (i) the business plan of the Company (the "***Business Plan***") and (ii) any and all right, title and interest the Purchaser has in the Company's business and any Intellectual Property (as defined below) related to the Company's business, as currently conducted and as contemplated to be conducted pursuant to the Business Plan or otherwise. For purposes hereof, "***Intellectual Property***" means: (i) United States and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights and mask works, registrations and applications therefor, and rights granted upon any reissue, division, continuation or continuation-in-part thereof, (ii) trade secret rights arising out of the laws of any and all jurisdictions, (iii) ideas, inventions, concepts, technology, software, methods, processes, drawings, illustrations, writings know-how, show-how, trade names, domain names, web addresses and web sites, and all rights therein and thereto, (iv) any other intellectual property rights, whether or not registrable, and (v) licenses in or to any of the foregoing. Further, the Purchaser agrees to take all actions reasonably requested by the Company to assist the Company in effecting the foregoing transfer and in establishing, perfecting, defending, enforcing and protecting the Company's rights in any of the above transferred items, including without limitation assisting in the prosecution of any patent applications included in or based upon the Intellectual Property.

## 2.  Closing.

The purchase and sale of the Shares shall occur at a closing (the "***Closing***") to be held on the date first set forth above, or at any other time mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Purchaser. The Closing will take place at the principal office of the Company or at such other place as shall be designated by the Company. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver the aggregate Purchase Price set forth above to the Company by wire transfer, check or any other method of payment permissible under applicable law and approved by the Company's board of directors (or any combination of such methods of payment), and the Company will issue, as promptly thereafter as practicable, a stock certificate, registered in the name of the Purchaser, reflecting the Shares.

## 3. Repurchase Option.

> A. ***Option.*** In the event the Purchaser ceases to be an employee, consultant, advisor, officer or director of the Company (a "***Service Provider***") for any or no reason, including, without limitation, by reason of the Purchaser's death or disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "***Code***"), "***Disability***"), resignation or involuntary termination, the Company shall, from such time (as determined by the Company in its discretion), have an irrevocable, exclusive option to repurchase (the "***Repurchase Option***") any Shares which have not yet been released from the Repurchase Option (the "***Unreleased Shares***"), at a price per share equal to the lesser of (x) the fair market value of the shares at the time the Repurchase Option is exercised, as determined by the Company's board of directors and (y) the Purchase Price (the "***Repurchase Price***"). The Company may exercise its Repurchase Option as to any or all of the Unreleased Shares at any time after the Purchaser ceases to be a Service Provider; *provided*, *however*, that without requirement of further action on the part of either party hereto, the Repurchase Option shall be deemed to have been automatically exercised as to all Unreleased Shares at 5:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) as of the date that is 60 days following the date the Purchaser ceases to be a Service Provider, unless the Company declines in writing to exercise its Repurchase Option prior to such time. 
> 
> B. ***Exercise.*** If the Company decides not to exercise its Repurchase Option, it shall notify the Purchaser in writing within 60 days of the date the Purchaser ceases to be a Service Provider. If the Repurchase Option is exercised or deemed exercised, within 90 days of the date the Purchaser ceases to be a Service Provider, the Company shall deliver payment to the Purchaser, with a copy to the Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 8 hereof), by any of the following methods, in the Company's sole discretion: (i) delivering to the Purchaser or the Purchaser's executor a check in the amount of the aggregate Repurchase Price, (ii) canceling an amount of the Purchaser's indebtedness to the Company equal to the aggregate Repurchase Price, or (iii) any combination of (i) and (ii) such that the combined payment and cancellation of indebtedness equals the aggregate Repurchase Price. 
> 
> C. ***Rights upon Exercise.*** In the event that the Repurchase Option is exercised or deemed exercised, the sole right and remedy of the Purchaser thereafter shall be to receive the Repurchase Price, and in no case shall the Purchaser have any claim of ownership as to any of the Unreleased Shares. 
> 
> D. ***Assignability.*** The Company in its sole discretion may assign all or part of the Repurchase Option to one or more employees, officers, directors or stockholders of the Company or other persons or organizations. 

## 4. Release of Shares from Repurchase Option; Vesting.

> A. ***Vesting.*** As of the date of this Agreement, 50% of the total number of Shares shall be released from the Repurchase Option. So long as the Purchaser's continuous status as a Service Provider has not yet terminated in *each* such instance, an additional 1/48th of the remaining number of Shares shall be released from the Repurchase Option on the corresponding day of each month thereafter (or if there is no corresponding day in any such month, on the last day of such month), until all Shares have been released on the fourth anniversary of this Agreement.
>
> B. ***Acceleration upon Termination after a Change of Control.*** In the event that the Purchaser's continuous status as a Service Provider is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined below) within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control (as defined below), 100% of the total number of Shares that have not been released from the Repurchase Option shall be immediately released from the Repurchase Option.

> > (1) the acquisition of the Company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation or stock transfer, but excluding any such transaction effected primarily for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company), unless the Company's stockholders of record immediately prior to such transaction or series of related transactions hold, immediately after such transaction or series of related transactions, at least 50% of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity (*provided* that the sale by the Company of its securities for the purposes of raising additional funds shall not constitute a Change of Control hereunder); or
> > 
> > (2) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. 
> 
> D. ***Delivery of Released Shares.*** Subject to the provisions of Section 8, the Shares which have been released from the Company's Repurchase Option shall be delivered to the Purchaser at the Purchaser's request.

> 
> > (1) delivered in full, or
> > 
> > (2) delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax,
> 
> whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the Purchaser on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Any reduction in payments and/or benefits required by this Section 5 will occur in the following order: (1) reduction of cash payments; (2) reduction of vesting acceleration of equity awards; and (3) reduction of other benefits paid or provided to Purchaser. In the event that acceleration of vesting of equity awards is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting will be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant for Purchaser's equity awards. If two or more equity awards are granted on the same date, each award will be reduced on a *pro-rata* basis. In no event will Purchaser exercise any discretion with respect to the ordering of any reductions of payments or benefits under this Section 5.
> 
> B. ***Determination.*** Unless the Company and the Purchaser otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 5 shall be made in writing by the Company's independent public accountants or a national "Big Four" accounting firm selected by the Company (the "***Accountants***"), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Purchaser and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 5, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Section 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Purchaser shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 5. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 5.

## 7. Company's Right of First Refusal.

Before any Shares acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (or any beneficial interest in such Shares) may be sold, transferred, encumbered or otherwise disposed of in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) by the Purchaser or any subsequent transferee (each a "***Holder***"), such Holder must first offer such Shares or beneficial interest to the Company and/or its assignee(s) as follows:

> A. ***Notice of Proposed Transfer.*** The Holder shall deliver to the Company a written notice stating: (i) the Holder's *bona fide* intention to sell or otherwise transfer the Shares; (ii) the name of each proposed transferee; (iii) the number of Shares to be transferred to each proposed transferee; (iv) the *bona fide* cash price or other consideration for which the Holder proposes to transfer the Shares; and (v) that by delivering the notice, the Holder offers all such Shares to the Company and/or its assignee(s) pursuant to this section and on the same terms described in the notice.
> 
> B. ***Exercise of Right of First Refusal.*** At any time within 30 days after receipt of the Holder's notice, the Company and/or its assignee(s) may, by giving written notice to the Holder, elect to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Shares proposed to be transferred to any one or more of the proposed transferees, at the purchase price determined in accordance with Section 7.C.
> 
> C. ***Purchase Price.*** The purchase price for the Shares purchased by the Company and/or its assignee(s) under this section shall be the price listed in the Holder's notice. If the price listed in the Holder's notice includes consideration other than cash, the cash equivalent value of the non‑cash consideration shall be determined by the board of directors of the Company in its sole discretion.

> 
> E. ***Holder's Right to Transfer.*** If all of the Shares proposed in the notice to be transferred to a given proposed transferee are not purchased by the Company and/or its assignee(s) as provided in this section, then the Holder may sell or otherwise transfer such Shares to that proposed transferee; *provided that*: (i) the transfer is made only on the terms provided for in the notice, with the exception of the purchase price, which may be either the price listed in the notice or any higher price; (ii) such transfer is consummated within 60 days after the date the notice is delivered to the Company; (iii) the transfer is effected in accordance with any applicable securities laws, and if requested by the Company, the Holder shall have delivered an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Company to that effect; and (iv) the proposed transferee agrees in writing to receive and hold the Shares so transferred subject to all of the provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to this section, and there shall be no further transfer of such Shares except in accordance with the terms of this section.

Upon such a transfer, the persons transferring or acquiring the Shares shall promptly notify the Secretary of the Company in writing of such transfer. The right to purchase such Shares shall be provided to the Company for a period of 30 days following receipt by the Company of written notice of the transfer.
> 
> G. ***Exception for Certain Family Transfers.*** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this section, the transfer of any or all of the Shares during the Holder's lifetime (except in connection with a divorce, dissolution, legal separation or annulment) or on the Holder's death by will or intestacy to (i) the Holder's spouse or domestic partner; (ii) the Holder's lineal descendants or antecedents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews (including adoptive relationships and step relationships), and their spouses or domestic partners; (iii) the lineal descendants or antecedents, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews of Holder's spouse or domestic partner (including adoptive relationships and step relationships), and their spouses or domestic partners; and (iv) a trust or other similar estate planning vehicle for the benefit of the Holder or any such person, shall be exempt from the provisions of this section; *provided* that, in each such case, the transferee agrees in writing to receive and hold the Shares so transferred subject to all of the provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to this section, and there shall be no further transfer of such Shares except in accordance with the terms of this section; and *provided* *further*, that without the prior written consent of the Company, which may be withheld in the sole discretion of the Company, no more than three transfers may be made pursuant to this section, including all transfers by the Holder and all transfers by any transferee.

> 
> H. ***Termination of Right of First Refusal.*** The rights contained in this section shall terminate as to all Shares purchased hereunder upon the earlier of: (i) the closing date of the first sale of Common Stock of the Company to the general public pursuant to a registration statement filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act, and (ii) the closing date of a Change of Control pursuant to which the holders of the outstanding voting securities of the Company receive securities of a class registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

## 8. Escrow.

> A. ***Deposit.*** As security for the faithful performance of this Agreement, the Purchaser agrees, immediately upon receipt of the certificate(s) evidencing the Shares, to deliver such certificate(s), together with a stock power in the form of **Exhibit B** attached to this Agreement, executed by the Purchaser and by the Purchaser's spouse, if any (with the date and number of Shares left blank), to the Secretary of the Company or to another designee of the Company (the "***Escrow Agent***"). These documents shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Joint Escrow Instructions of the Company and the Purchaser set forth in **Exhibit C** attached to this Agreement, which instructions are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference, and which instructions shall also be delivered to the Escrow Agent after the Closing.
> 
> B. ***Rights in Escrow Shares.*** Subject to the terms hereof, the Purchaser shall have all the rights of a stockholder with respect to such Shares while they are held in escrow, including without limitation, the right to vote the Shares. If, from time to time during the term of the Company's Repurchase Option, there is (i) any stock dividend, stock split or other change in the Shares, (ii) any dividend of cash or other property on the Shares, or (iii) any merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets or other acquisition of the Company, any and all new, substituted or additional securities or cash or other consideration to which the Purchaser is entitled by reason of the Purchaser's ownership of the Shares shall immediately become subject to this escrow, deposited with the Escrow Agent and included thereafter as "***Shares***" for purposes of this Agreement and the Company's Repurchase Option.

## 9. Tax Consequences.

The Purchaser has reviewed with the Purchaser's own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. The Purchaser understands that the Purchaser (and not the Company) shall be responsible for any tax liability that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser understands that Section 83 of the Code, taxes as ordinary income the difference between the purchase price for the Shares and the fair market value of the Shares as of the date any restrictions on the Shares lapse. In this context, "restriction" includes the right of the Company to buy back the Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Option. The Purchaser understands that the Purchaser may elect to be taxed at the time the Shares are purchased rather than when and as the Repurchase Option expires by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the IRS within 30 days from the date of purchase. **The form for making this section 83(b) election is attached to this agreement as *Exhibit D* and the Purchaser (and not the Company or any of its agents) shall be solely responsible for appropriately filing such form, even if the purchaser requests the company or its agents to make this filing on THE purchaser's behalf.**

**INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION STATEMENT**

|**INVESTMENT:**|
|-|
|PURCHASER: [purchaser-name]|
|COMPANY: [company-name]|
|SECURITY: Common Stock|
|AMOUNT: [shares-amount]|
|DATE: [date-of-adoption]|

In connection with the purchase of the above-listed shares, I, the undersigned purchaser, represent to the Company as follows:

> 1.  ***The Company may rely on these representations.*** I understand that the Company's sale of the shares to me has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "***Securities Act***"), because the Company believes, relying in part on my representations in this document, that an exemption from such registration requirement is available for such sale. I understand that the availability of this exemption depends upon the representations I am making to the Company in this document being true and correct.
> 
> 2.  ***I am purchasing for investment.*** I am purchasing the shares solely for investment purposes, and not for further distribution. My entire legal and beneficial ownership interest in the shares is being purchased and shall be held solely for my account, except to the extent I intend to hold the shares jointly with my spouse. I am not a party to, and do not presently intend to enter into, any contract or other arrangement with any other person or entity involving the resale, transfer, grant of participation with respect to or other distribution of any of the shares. My investment intent is not limited to my present intention to hold the shares for the minimum capital gains period specified under any applicable tax law, for a deferred sale, for a specified increase or decrease in the market price of the shares, or for any other fixed period in the future.
> 
> 3.  ***I can protect my own interests.*** I can properly evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in the shares and can protect my own interests in this regard, whether by reason of my own business and financial expertise, the business and financial expertise of certain professional advisors unaffiliated with the Company with whom I have consulted, or my preexisting business or personal relationship with the Company or any of its officers, directors or controlling persons.
> 
> 4.  ***I am informed about the Company.*** I am sufficiently aware of the Company's business affairs and financial condition to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the shares. I have had opportunity to discuss the plans, operations and financial condition of the Company with its officers, directors or controlling persons, and have received all information I deem appropriate for assessing the risk of an investment in the shares.
> 
> 5.  ***I recognize my economic risk.*** I realize that the purchase of the shares involves a high degree of risk, and that the Company's future prospects are uncertain. I am able to hold the shares indefinitely if required, and am able to bear the loss of my entire investment in the shares.
> 
> 6.  ***I know that the shares are restricted securities.*** I understand that the shares are "restricted securities" in that the Company's sale of the shares to me has not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon an exemption for non-public offerings. In this regard, I also understand and agree that:
> 
> > A.  I must hold the shares indefinitely, unless any subsequent proposed resale by me is registered under the Securities Act, or unless an exemption from registration is otherwise available (such as Rule 144);
> > 
> > B.  the Company is under no obligation to register any subsequent proposed resale of the shares by me; *and*
> > 
> > C.  the certificate evidencing the shares will be imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of the shares unless such transfer is registered or such registration is not required in the opinion of counsel for the Company.
> 
> 7.  ***I am familiar with Rule 144.*** I am familiar with Rule 144 adopted under the Securities Act, which in some circumstances permits limited public resales of "restricted securities" like the shares acquired from an issuer in a non-public offering. I understand that my ability to sell the shares under Rule 144 in the future is uncertain, and may depend upon, among other things: (i) the availability of certain current public information about the Company; (ii) the resale occurring more than a specified period after my purchase and full payment (within the meaning of Rule 144) for the shares; and (iii) if I am an affiliate of the Company (A) the sale being made in an unsolicited "broker's transaction", transactions directly with a market maker or riskless principal transactions, as those terms are defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (B) the amount of shares being sold during any three-month period not exceeding the specified limitations stated in Rule 144, *and* (C) timely filing of a notice of proposed sale on Form 144, if applicable.
> 
> 8.  ***I know that Rule 144 may never be available.*** I understand that the requirements of Rule 144 may never be met, and that the shares may never be saleable under the rule. I further understand that at the time I wish to sell the shares, there may be no public market for the Company's stock upon which to make such a sale, or the current public information requirements of Rule 144 may not be satisfied, either of which may preclude me from selling the shares under Rule 144 even if the relevant holding period had been satisfied.
> 
> 9.  ***I know that I am subject to further restrictions on resale.*** I understand that in the event Rule 144 is not available to me, any future proposed sale of any of the shares by me will not be possible without prior registration under the Securities Act, compliance with some other registration exemption (which may or may not be available), or *each* of the following: (i) my written notice to the Company containing detailed information regarding the proposed sale, (ii) my providing an opinion of my counsel to the effect that such sale will not require registration, and (iii) the Company notifying me in writing that its counsel concurs in such opinion. I understand that neither the Company nor its counsel is obligated to provide me with any such opinion. I understand that although Rule 144 is not exclusive, the Staff of the SEC has stated that persons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering or pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk.
> 
> 10. ***I know that I may have tax liability due to the uncertain value of the shares.*** I understand that the board of directors believes its valuation of the shares represents a fair appraisal of their worth, but that it remains possible that, with the benefit of hindsight, the Internal Revenue Service may successfully assert that the value of the shares on the date of my purchase is substantially greater than the Board's appraisal. I understand that any additional value ascribed to the shares by such an IRS determination will constitute ordinary income to me as of the purchase date, and that any additional taxes and interest due as a result will be my sole responsibility payable only by me, and that the Company need not and will not reimburse me for that tax liability.
> 
> 11. ***Residence.*** The address of my principal residence is set forth on the signature page below.

By signing below, I acknowledge my agreement with each of the statements contained in this Investment Representation Statement as of the date first set forth above, and my intent for the Company to rely on such statements in issuing the shares to me.
