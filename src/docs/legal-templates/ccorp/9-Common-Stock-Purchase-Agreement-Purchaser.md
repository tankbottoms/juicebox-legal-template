This Stock Purchase Agreement (the "**Agreement**") is made as of [Date] by and between [Company-name], a Delaware corporation (the "**Company**"), and [Purchaser-name], a [Purchaser-entity] (the "**Purchaser**").

In consideration of the mutual covenants and representations set forth below, the Company and Purchaser agree as follows:

## 1. Purchase and Sale of the Shares.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company agrees to sell to Purchaser and Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Company [Shares-amount] shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "**Shares**") at a price of $[Share-price] per share (the "**Purchase Price**"), for an aggregate purchase price of $[Aggregate-purchase-price].

## 2. Issuance of Shares.

The purchase and sale of the Shares will take place at the principal office of the Company or at such other place as shall be designated by the Company. Purchaser shall execute and deliver this Agreement, and the Company will issue, as promptly thereafter as practicable, a stock certificate, registered in the name of the Purchaser, reflecting the Shares.

## 3. Restrictions on Transfer.

> A. Purchaser understands and agrees that the Company shall cause the legends set forth below, or substantially equivalent legends, to be placed upon any certificate(s) evidencing ownership of the Shares, together with any other legends that may be required by the Company or by applicable state or federal securities laws:
>
> > THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "_ACT_") AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR, IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES, SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE ACT.
> >
> > THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL HELD BY THE ISSUER OR ITS ASSIGNEE(S) AS SET FORTH IN THE COMMON STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ISSUER AND THE ORIGINAL HOLDER OF THESE SHARES, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE ISSUER. SUCH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL ARE BINDING ON TRANSFEREES OF THESE SHARES.
>
> B. _Stop-Transfer Notices_. Purchaser agrees that to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to herein, the Company may issue appropriate "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent, if any, and that, if the Company transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own records.
>
> C. _Refusal to Transfer_. The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any Shares that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) to treat as owner of such Shares or to accord the right to vote or pay dividends to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such Shares shall have been so transferred.
>
> D. _Lock-Up Period_. Purchaser hereby agrees that Purchaser shall not sell, offer, pledge, contract to sell, grant any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any right or warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or encumber, directly or indirectly, any Shares or other securities of the Company, nor shall Purchaser enter into any swap, hedging or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Shares or other securities of the Company, during the 180-day period (or such other period as may be requested by the Company or the underwriters to accommodate regulatory restrictions on (i) the publication or other distribution of research reports and (ii) analyst recommendations and opinions, including, but not limited to, the restrictions contained in FINRA or NYSE rules, or any successor provisions or amendments thereto) following the effective date of the first registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act that includes securities to be sold on behalf of the Company to the public in an underwritten public offering under the Securities Act. Purchaser further agrees, if so requested by the Company or any representative of its underwriters, to enter into such underwriter's standard form of "lockup" or "market standoff" agreement in a form satisfactory to the Company and such underwriter. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to securities subject to the foregoing restrictions until the end of such period.

## 4. Company's Right of First Refusal.

Before any Shares acquired by the purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (or any beneficial interest in such Shares) may be sold, gifted, transferred, encumbered or otherwise disposed of in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) by the Purchaser or any subsequent transferee (each a "**Holder**"), such Holder must first offer such Shares or beneficial interest to the Company and/or its assignee(s) as follows:

> A. _Notice of Proposed Transfer_. The Holder shall deliver to the Company a written notice stating: (i) the Holder's bona fide intention to sell or otherwise transfer the Shares; (ii) the name of each proposed transferee; (iii) the number of Shares to be transferred to each proposed transferee; (iv) the bona fide cash price or other consideration for which the Holder pro­poses to transfer the Shares; and (v) that by delivering the notice, the Holder offers all such Shares to the Company and/or its assignee(s) pursuant to this Section and on the same terms described in the notice.
>
> B. _Exercise of Right of First Refusal_. At any time within 30 days after receipt of the Holder's notice, the Company and/or its assignee(s) may, by giving written notice to the Holder, elect to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Shares proposed to be transferred to any one or more of the proposed transferees, at the purchase price determined in accordance with Section 4.C.
>
> C. _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Shares purchased by the Company and/or its assignee(s) under this Section shall be the price listed in the Holder's notice. If the price listed in the Holder's notice includes consideration other than cash, the cash equivalent value of the non‑cash consideration shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in its sole discretion.
>
> D. _Payment_. Payment of the purchase price shall be made, at the option of the Company and/or its assignee(s), in cash (by check), by cancellation of all or a portion of any outstanding indebtedness of the Holder to the Company and/or its assignee(s), or by any combination thereof within 30 days after receipt by the Company of the Holder's notice (or at such later date as is called for by such notice).
>
> E. _Holder's Right to Transfer_. If all of the Shares proposed in the notice to be transferred to a given proposed transferee are not purchased by the Company and/or its assignee(s) as provided in this Section, then the Holder may sell or otherwise transfer such Shares to that proposed transferee, **provided that**: (i) the transfer is made only on the terms provided for in the notice, with the exception of the purchase price, which may be either the price listed in the notice or any higher price; (ii) such transfer is consummated within 60 days after the date the notice is delivered to the Company; (iii) the transfer is effected in accordance with any applicable securities laws, and if requested by the Company, the Holder shall have delivered an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Company to that effect; and (iv) the proposed transferee agrees in writing that the provisions of this Section shall continue to apply to the transferred Shares in the hands of such proposed transferee. If any Shares described in a notice are not transferred to the proposed transferee within the period provided above, then before any such Shares may be transferred, a new notice shall be given to the Company, and the Company and/or its assignees shall again be offered the right of first refusal described in this Section.
>
> F. _Exception for Certain Family Transfers_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Section, the transfer of any or all of the Shares during the Holder's lifetime or on the Holder's death by will or intestacy to the Holder's spouse, child, father, mother, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, grandfather, grandmother, grandchild, cousin, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, stepchild, or to a trust or other similar estate planning vehicle or the benefit of the Holder or any such person, shall be exempt from the provisions of this Section; **provided that**, in each such case, the transferee shall agree in writing to receive and hold the Shares so transferred subject to all of the provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to this Section, and there shall be no further transfer of such Shares except in accordance with the terms of this Section.
>
> G. _Termination of Right of First Refusal_. The right of first refusal contained in this Section shall terminate as to all Shares purchased hereunder upon the earlier of: (i) the closing date of the first sale of Common Stock of the Company to the general public pursuant to a registration statement filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act, as amended, and (ii) the closing date of a Change of Control of the Company pursuant to which the holders of the outstanding voting securities of the Company receive securities of a class registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
>
> For purposes of this Agreement, a "**Change of Control**" means either:
>
> > (1) the acquisition of the Company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation or stock transfer, but excluding any such transaction effected primarily for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company), unless the Company's stockholders of record immediately prior to such transaction or series of related transactions hold, immediately after such transaction or series of related transactions, at least a majority of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity (provided that the sale by the Company of its securities for the purposes of raising additional funds shall not constitute a Change of Control hereunder); or
> >
> > (2) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

## 5. Tax Consequences.

The Purchaser has reviewed with the Purchaser's own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. The Purchaser understands that the Purchaser (and not the Company) shall be responsible for any tax liability that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

## 6. General Provisions.

> A. _Choice of Law; Entire Agreement_. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws, but not the choice of law rules, of Delaware.
>
> B. _Integration_. This Agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the purchase of the Shares by the Purchaser and supersedes and replaces any and all prior written or oral agreements regarding the subject matter of this Agreement including, but not limited to, any representations made during any interviews, relocation discussions or negotiations whether written or oral.
>
> C. _Notices_. Any notice, demand, offer, request or other communication required or permitted to be given by either the Company or the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given the earlier of (i) when received, (ii) when delivered personally, (iii) 1 business day after being delivered by facsimile (with receipt of appropriate confirmation), (iv) 1 business day after being deposited with an overnight courier service or (v) 4 days after being deposited in the U.S. mail, First Class with postage prepaid, and addressed to the parties at the addresses provided to the Company (which the Company agrees to disclose to the other parties upon request) or such other address as a party may request by notifying the other in writing.
>
> D. _Successors_. Any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the Company's business and/or assets shall assume the obligations under this Agreement and agree expressly to perform the obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Company would be required to perform such obligations in the absence of a succession. For all purposes under this Agreement, the term "**Company**" shall include any successor to the Company's business and/or assets which executes and delivers the assumption agreement described in this Section or which becomes bound by the terms of this Agreement by operation of law. Subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding upon Purchaser and his heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.
>
> E. _Assignment_. The rights granted to the Purchaser under this Agreement are not assignable by the Purchaser under any circumstances.
>
> F. _Waiver_. Either party's failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision, nor prevent that party from thereafter enforcing any other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted both parties hereunder are cumulative and shall not constitute a waiver of either party's right to assert any other legal remedy available to it.
>
> G. _Purchaser Investment Representations and Further Documents_. The Purchaser agrees upon request to execute any further documents or instruments necessary or reasonably desirable in the view of the Company to carry out the purposes or intent of this Agreement. In furtherance of the above, the Purchaser hereby makes the investment representations listed on **Exhibit A** to the Company as of the date of this Agreement, and agrees that such representations are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference, such that the Company may rely on them in issuing the Shares.
>
> H. _Severability_. Should any provision of this Agreement be found to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions shall nevertheless remain effective and shall remain enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by law.
>
> I. _Rights as Stockholder_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall have all of the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Shares from and after the date that Purchaser delivers a fully executed copy of this Agreement (including all exhibits and attachments thereto) and full payment for the Shares to the Company, and until such time as Purchaser disposes of the Shares in accordance with this Agreement. Upon such transfer, Purchaser shall have no further rights as a holder of the Shares so purchased except (in the case of a transfer to the Company) the right to receive payment for the Shares so purchased in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and Purchaser shall forthwith cause the certificate(s) evidencing the Shares so purchased to be surrendered to the Company for transfer or cancellation.
>
> J. _Adjustment for Stock Split._ All references to the number of Shares and the purchase price of the Shares in this Agreement shall be adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or other change in the Shares which may be made after the date of this Agreement.

## EXHIBIT A

**INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION STATEMENT**

| **INVESTMENT:**                |
| ------------------------------ |
| PURCHASER: [Purchaser-entity]  |
| COMPANY: [Company-name]        |
| SECURITY: Common Stock         |
| AMOUNT: [Shares-amount] shares |
| DATE: [Date]                   |

In connection with the purchase of the above-listed shares, I represent to the Company as follows:

> 1.  _The Company May Rely on These Representations_. I understand that the Company's sale of the shares to me has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, because the Company believes, relying in part on my representations in this document, that an exemption from such registration requirement is available for such sale. I understand that the availability of this exemption depends upon the representations I am making to the Company in this document being true and correct.
>
> 2.  _I am Purchasing for Investment_. I am purchasing the shares solely for investment purposes, and not for further distribution. My entire legal and beneficial ownership interest in the shares is being purchased and shall be held solely for my account, except to the extent I intend to hold the shares jointly with my spouse. I am not a party to, and do not presently intend to enter into, any contract or other arrangement with any other person or entity involving the resale, transfer, grant of participation with respect to or other distribution of any of the shares. My investment intent is not limited to my present intention to hold the shares for the minimum capital gains period specified under any applicable tax law, for a deferred sale, for a specified increase or decrease in the market price of the shares, or for any other fixed period in the future.
>
> 3.  _I Can Protect My Own Interests_. I can properly evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in the shares and can protect my own interests in this regard, whether by reason of my own business and financial expertise, the business and financial expertise of certain professional advisors unaffiliated with the Company with whom I have consulted, or my preexisting business or personal relationship with the Company or any of its officers, directors or controlling persons.
>
> 4.  _I am Informed About the Company_. I am sufficiently aware of the Company's business affairs and financial condition to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the shares. I have had opportunity to discuss the plans, operations and financial condition of the Company with its officers, directors or controlling persons, and have received all information I deem appropriate for assessing the risk of an investment in the shares.
>
> 5.  _I Recognize My Economic Risk_. I realize that the purchase of the shares involves a high degree of risk, and that the Company's future prospects are uncertain. I am able to hold the shares indefinitely if required, and am able to bear the loss of my entire investment in the shares.
>
> 6.  _I Know the Shares are Restricted Securities_. I understand that the shares are "restricted securities" in that the Company's sale of the shares to me has not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon an exemption for non-public offerings. In this regard, I also understand and agree that:
>
> > A. I must hold the shares indefinitely, unless any subsequent proposed resale by me is registered under the Securities Act, or unless an exemption from registration is otherwise available (such as Rule 144);
> >
> > B. the Company is under no obligation to register any subsequent proposed resale of the shares by me; **an**d
> >
> > C. the certificate evidencing the shares will be imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of the shares unless such transfer is registered or such registration is not required in the opinion of counsel for the Company.
>
> 7.  _I am Familiar With Rule 144_. I am familiar with Rule 144 adopted under the Securities Act, which in some circumstances permits limited public resale of "restricted securities" like the shares acquired from an issuer in a non-public offering. I understand that my ability to sell the shares under Rule 144 in the future is uncertain, and will depend upon, among other things: (i) the availability of certain current public information about the Company; (ii) the resale occurring more than one year after my purchase and full payment (within the meaning of Rule 144) for the shares; **and** (iii) if I am an affiliate of the Company, or a non-affiliate who has held the shares less than two years after my purchase and full payment: (A) the sale being made through a broker in an unsolicited "broker's transaction" or in transactions directly with a market maker, as said term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (B) the amount of shares being sold during any three month period not exceeding the specified limitations stated in Rule 144, **and** (C) timely filing of a notice of proposed sale on Form 144, if applicable.
>
> 8.  _I Know Rule 144 May Never be Available_. I understand that the requirements of Rule 144 may never be met, and that the shares may never be saleable. I further understand that at the time I wish to sell the shares, there may be no public market for the Company's stock upon which to make such a sale, or the current public information requirements of Rule 144 may not be satisfied, either of which would preclude me from selling the shares under Rule 144 even if the one-year minimum holding period had been satisfied.
>
> 9.  _I Know I am Subject to Further Restrictions on Resale_. I understand that in the event Rule 144 is not available to me, any future proposed sale of any of the shares by me will not be possible without prior registration under the Securities Act, compliance with some other registration exemption (which may or may not be available), or **each** of the following: (i) my written notice to the Company containing detailed information regarding the proposed sale, (ii) my providing an opinion of my counsel to the effect that such sale will not require registration, and (iii) the Company notifying me in writing that its counsel concurs in such opinion. I understand that neither the Company nor its counsel is obligated to provide me with any such opinion. I understand that although Rule 144 is not exclusive, the Staff of the SEC has stated that persons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering or pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk.
>
> 10. _I Know I May Have Tax Liability Due to the Uncertain Value of the Shares_. I understand that the Board of Directors believes its valuation of the shares represents a fair appraisal of their worth, but that it remains possible that, with the benefit of hindsight, the Internal Revenue Service may successfully assert that the value of the shares on the date of my purchase is substantially greater than the Board's appraisal. I understand that any additional value ascribed to the shares by such an IRS determination will constitute ordinary income to me as of the purchase date, and that any additional taxes and interest due as a result will be my sole responsibility payable only by me, and that the Company need not and will not reimburse me for that tax liability. I understand that if such additional value represents more than 25% of my gross income for the year in which the value of the shares is taxable, the IRS will have 6 years from the due date for filing the return (or the actual filing date of the return if filed thereafter) within which to assess me the additional tax and interest due.

By signing below, I acknowledge my agreement with each of the statements contained in this Investment Representation Statement as of the date first set forth above, and my intent for the Company to rely on such statements in issuing the shares to me.
