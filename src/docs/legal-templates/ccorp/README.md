## Overview.

A C corporation (or C-corp) is a legal structure for a corporation in which the owners, or shareholders, are taxed separately from the entity. C corporations, the most prevalent of corporations, are also subject to corporate income taxation. The taxing of profits from the business is at both corporate and personal levels, creating a double taxation situation.

C-corps can be compared with S corporations and limited liability companies (LLCs), among others, which also separate a company's assets from its owners, but with different legal structures and tax treatment. A newer type of organization is the B-corporation (or benefit corporation), which is a for-profit firm but different from C-corps in purpose, accountability, and transparency, but aren’t different in how they’re taxed.

- A C Corp legally separates owners' or shareholders' assets and income from that of the corporation.
- C corporations limit the liability of investors and firm owners since the most that they can lose in the business's failure is the amount they have invested in it.
- C corporations are mandated to hold annual meetings and have a board of directors that is voted on by shareholders.[^1]

## Jurisdiction.

The following documents are written for the juridiction, or State of Delaware. Each State has adopted specific State laws regulating Corporations, Partnerships, and other business entities, the states and their respective laws differ in areas of personal liability for business debts and business' tax obligations. Generally speaking, corporate laws outline the rights, responsibilities, and procedures for each given business structure. While you may want to consult a paralegal or attorney on the matter generally or specifically, the following documents can not simply be updated from Delaware to whichever state you wish to operate, but the corporate law statute it likely also references will also need to be updated. The following table references the state statue which corresponds with corporate law.
