## Unincorporated Nonprofit Association

"Unincorporated association" means an unincorporated group of two or more persons joined by mutual consent for a common lawful purpose, whether organized for profit or not.

#### The Fund Raise Project

The Fund Raise Project is the type of Project where an individual (or a group of individuals collectively) solicits donation of funds for a particular purpose. In addition to formalizing a non-profit for the specific purpose, a one-time Fund Raise maybe accomplished via a [trust agreement](./Resources/trusts/trust.md) where as the contributors are the grantors, the individual who created the **Juicebox Project** is the trustee, and the beneficiary is the individual(s) who will receive the funds.

Whether an attorney is available to help prepare the documents, or you edit the documents and make them available to the community, this device has substantial statutory law protecting the contributors and the beneficiary.
