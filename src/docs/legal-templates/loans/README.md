# Loans

Loans, also called Promissory Notes, are usually for money but can also be for property. The basic premise is that the agreement is to repay the lender, depending on the jurisdiction, the interest that is legal may differ however there are little limitations to the duration and repayment terms. The term secured, and non-recourse, are particular to the rights the lender may have if the borrower is unable to repay.

Secured means that the loan is secured by some type of collateral, such as a piece of property or asset, like an NFT. Unsecured means that you have no right to any property or collateral even if the loaned funds were used to purchase it. Usually, loans which are unsecured carry higher interest rates.

Individuals use promissory notes to purchase property which involved more money then they have, or are willing to spend. Companies use promissory notes, usually, to delay computing the value of the company, or shares, until a later date, or to purchase some type of asset. As long as the interest rate is legal, there is no limit to the number of promissory notes a party may borrow or enter into.

Promissory notes are often abused by individuals or entities with no intention in repaying them. Individuals with secret off-shore undisclosed assets in the Cayman Islands may use promissory notes to represent magical funds or assets, however, entering into illusory promissory notes is questionable legally, and likely results in the money or benefit being confirmed considered income. Therefore, aside from honestly entering into a promissory note with the intention of repaying it, its important the following features are well understood.

1. the parties involved
2. the amount of the loan
3. the amount to be repaid
4. when and how often the payments are to be made
5. repayment, dates if possible
6. what happens when a payment is late or isn't repaid
7. interest rate, fixed variable or increases over time
8. party responsible for repaying the loan
9. collateral or security
10. any rights transferring or assigning the promissory note (promissory notes can be transferable)
11. date and place of issuance
12. party offering, signature
